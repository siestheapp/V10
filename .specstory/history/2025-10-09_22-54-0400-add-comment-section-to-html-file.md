<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating comment teaser design**

I'm thinking about how to design a clean comment teaser row. It should have a small box displaying "Comments · 12" in smaller gray text, followed by a line with "Q: ... A: ..." and a link saying "See full thread >". This needs to match the existing style, considering CSS classes like .look-caption and .sub for font sizes. I'll also create a new CSS block for .comment-teaser. Though this is a relatively straightforward change, I should still use the tool, as it's part of a multi-step process.
**Updating comment teaser CSS**

I’m planning to do a status update before using the apply_patch tool. First, I’ll ensure I follow the coding rules, especially when referencing existing code. I think I can parallelize the work, but since it’s only one file, it’s pretty straightforward.

For the CSS, I’ll add the .comment-teaser definition in the style section, probably around line 89. This will include properties like width, text alignment, margin, border radius, and hover effects. I'll detail styles for elements within the comment teaser too, ensuring everything looks cohesive.
**Inserting HTML snippet**

I’m planning to insert an HTML snippet for the comment teaser, which will display the number of comments and a sample question and answer. I’ll place this just after the 'dots' around line 192-196, probably before the closing div of look-caption.

I want to ensure it has proper semantics, so I can use a div with a role of button or possibly a button element. Using a button will allow keyboard focus and have better CSS styling, though there’s an earlier rule setting borders to none for buttons. I believe I can style the .comment-teaser with borders using higher specificity to override that rule.
**Implementing CSS and HTML changes**

I’m aware that the current rule sets the background to none, so I’ll change it to white, which makes sense. The button also has focus-visible outlines, which is a good feature to keep. 

As I implement these changes, it's important that I maintain consistent indentation, using 2 spaces as per the existing HTML style. I only need to update two areas: adding the new CSS rules and placing the HTML block inside the first article's look-caption. Now, I can proceed to apply the patch.</details></think>

I’m going to add a small “comment teaser” UI to the first look card in `size-twin-gallery.html`, including minimal CSS for styling, and place it below the image dots within the caption.

I added a styled “comment teaser” under the first look card’s caption in `freestyle-october/assets/iframe/size-twin-gallery.html` and included minimal CSS. I’m going to check for any linter warnings now.

i hnoestly prefer the structure in @twins_screen_annotated_mockup_react (1).jsx 
lets keep this line AnthropologieSomerset Maxi Dress — XS
add this below it Swipe to see what else she wears.
add two buttons on the same line 'Shop this item' and 'See more from ellaa76'

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting button styles**

I'm reviewing the CSS code, specifically around lines 84-96. I see I'm working with styles for actions and buttons. I plan to add the `.btn-outline` style after the `.btn-primary` rules. I'm also thinking it makes sense to remove `flex:1` from `.btn-primary`. This is important because, with two buttons, we don't want the primary button taking up too much space, which could make the second button too small and undesirable. I want both to look good together!
**Refining button styles again**

I'm focusing on the button styles, especially the `.btn-primary` class used in the second card for 'Shop this look (S)'. I think it shouldn't have `flex: 1` since it previously looked fine on its own. If I remove `flex: 1` across the board, the primary button in the second card will shrink, which might be acceptable. To play it safe, I can add `.btn-primary--fit` to the first card to ensure it maintains auto width, while leaving the second card unchanged with `flex: 1`.
**Implementing button styles**

I’ve decided to keep `flex: 1` for the second card while applying `.btn-primary--fit` to the first card, which seems like a good solution. I’ll also add a `.btn-outline` style to complement the buttons nicely. Next, I need to look for the HTML block starting at `<div class="look-caption">` from line 187 onward so I can modify it appropriately. It’s time to craft the `apply_patch` with these updates!</details></think>

I'll update the caption area in `size-twin-gallery.html` to match the preferred structure: keep the product line, add the swipe subcopy beneath it, and place two buttons side-by-side. I'll also add a lightweight `.btn-outline` style.

Updated the first card caption in `freestyle-october/assets/iframe/size-twin-gallery.html`:

- Kept product line: `AnthropologieSomerset Maxi Dress — XS`
- Added subcopy below: “Swipe to see what else she wears.”
- Placed two buttons on one line: “Shop this item” (primary) and “See more from ellaa76” (outline)
- Added `.btn-outline` style to match the look of the React mock.

Want me to apply the same structure to other cards if/when they appear?
