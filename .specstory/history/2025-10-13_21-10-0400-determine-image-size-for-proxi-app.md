# Determine image size for proxi app (2025-10-13 21:10-0400)

_**User (2025-10-13 22:12-0400)**_

ok we need to figure out the technical rules of the proxi app. what size is each miage in the first card on @feed-unified.html ? the first one is bigger. i think we will need to set up some kind of system that autocrops images to the dimensions of the first photo and then makes them available for upload to the app

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating card styles**

I’m analyzing the second card’s styling. The card has a border of 1px, with the image box positioned relatively and set to overflow hidden. The image inside is set to 100% width and 440px height. I’m checking whether the card has border and no padding. It does, and the card’s width is set to 378px. The border doesn’t affect the total content width, meaning the inner space equals 376px after accounting for the border.
**Analyzing aspect ratios**

I'm calculating the aspect ratios here. The ratio 2:3 equals about 0.6667, while 354/520 gives me 0.6808, which is close to 2:2.938 and 35:51. The difference from 0.68 to 0.667 is about 2%, indicating a tallish orientation near 2:3. This suggests I should target a crop ratio of 2:3. The CSS sets a fixed height of 520px, and width is fluid, so it could change across devices. I'm proposing cropping guidelines, recommending a pixel export resolution of 1068 x 1602 for retina.
**Clarifying image details**

The images in the "first card" might have some transforms, like the second slide using a CSS transform to translate Y by -40px. If we standardize cropping beforehand, we wouldn’t need that. The cropping should focus on the top of the frame, utilizing tactics like 'entropy' or 'attention' cropping. I'm determining the sizes for images in the first card, which should have a defined size of 354x520px. Both slides share this size, but the first feels bigger due to its height difference compared to the second card at 440px.
**Summarizing image specifications**

I want to lay out some key points about the images. The first card, used as a proxy carousel, has images rendered at 354x520 CSS pixels with a frame width of 430, giving it a 2:3 ratio. Both slides are the same size, but the second slide shifts up by 40px. For the second card's images, the size is 376x440 for reference. I’ll propose technical rules to standardize hero images at a 2:3 portrait ratio and consider whether to keep the `.pc-hero-img` height set to auto.</details></think>

### Image sizes in the first card (feed-unified.html)

- Both slides in the first (proxy) card render inside a 2:3 portrait box at approximately **354 × 520 CSS px** in this mock (430 px phone frame → 24 px feed padding → 12 px card padding).
  - Same size for both slides; the second slide is just nudged up by 40 px, which makes it feel different.

Key CSS references:
```435:436:freestyle-october/assets/iframe/feed-unified.html
.pc-hero-img{display:block;width:100%;height:520px;object-fit:cover;border-radius:14px}
```
```466:473:freestyle-october/assets/iframe/feed-unified.html
.proxy-card .pc-carousel{
  position:relative;
  display:grid;
  height:520px;
  overflow:hidden;
  border-radius:14px;
}
```
```571:574:freestyle-october/assets/iframe/feed-unified.html
.proxy-card:has(.pc-slide[data-title="Peregrine Midi Dress"].pc-active) .pc-match{
  margin:0px 6px 0px 56px !important;
}
```
```549:552:freestyle-october/assets/iframe/feed-unified.html
.pc-slide[data-title="Peregrine Midi Dress"] .pc-hero-img{
  transform:translateY(-40px) !important;
  border-radius:14px !important;
}
```
For comparison, the second (size-guide) card image is ~376 × 440 px:
```139:140:freestyle-october/assets/iframe/feed-unified.html
.img{width:100%;height:440px;object-fit:cover;object-position:center 22%}
```

### Proposed autocrop rules for Proxi hero images

- Aspect ratio: **2:3 (portrait)** to match the 520 px fixed height box.
- Delivery sizes (minimum):
  - 1x: 354 × 520
  - 2x: 708 × 1040
  - 3x: 1062 × 1560
- Format: **WebP** primary, with JPEG fallback if needed.
- Crop focus: top/center bias to keep faces and upper torso in frame (approx “center 22%” feel).

### Example processing script (Node + Sharp)

```bash
npm i sharp
```

```javascript
// scripts/autocrop-proxy-hero.js
// Usage: node scripts/autocrop-proxy-hero.js input.jpg outputBaseName (no extension)
import sharp from 'sharp';
import fs from 'fs';

const [,, input, outBase = 'proxy_hero'] = process.argv;
if (!input) {
  console.error('Usage: node scripts/autocrop-proxy-hero.js input.jpg [outputBaseName]');
  process.exit(1);
}

// Target 2:3 crops at 1x/2x/3x
const targets = [
  { suffix: '@1x', w: 354,  h: 520 },
  { suffix: '@2x', w: 708,  h: 1040 },
  { suffix: '@3x', w: 1062, h: 1560 },
];

(async () => {
  for (const t of targets) {
    const pipeline = sharp(input)
      // Use attention-based cover crop; switch to 'entropy' if better for your set
      .resize(t.w, t.h, { fit: 'cover', position: sharp.strategy.attention })
      .withMetadata();

    // webp
    await pipeline
      .webp({ quality: 82 })
      .toFile(`${outBase}${t.suffix}.webp`);

    // jpeg fallback
    await pipeline
      .jpeg({ quality: 84, mozjpeg: true })
      .toFile(`${outBase}${t.suffix}.jpg`);
  }
  console.log('Done:', targets.map(t => `${outBase}${t.suffix}.{webp,jpg}`).join(', '));
})();
```

### How to reference in HTML

```html
<img
  class="pc-hero-img pc-hero-img--tight"
  src="./assets/img/proxy_hero@1x.jpg"
  srcset="
    ./assets/img/proxy_hero@1x.webp 354w,
    ./assets/img/proxy_hero@2x.webp 708w,
    ./assets/img/proxy_hero@3x.webp 1062w"
  sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 354px"
  alt="Hero" />
```

- Place processed files under `freestyle-october/assets/img/` (or a `proxy/` subfolder).
- Keep CSS `object-fit: cover;` to preserve consistent presentation.

- First card images: 354 × 520 CSS px (2:3 portrait), both slides same; slide 2 is shifted up 40 px for framing.
- Autocrop spec provided (2:3, WebP/JPEG, 1x/2x/3x) with a Sharp script and example HTML `srcset` for upload-ready assets.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing CSS Tokens Addition**

I need to add tokens to the `freestyle-tokens.css` file. Since we're in ask mode and can't write directly, I should propose a diff or code snippet for the user to paste. It's crucial to use the right formatting, applying Markdown only for the code snippets and ensuring minimal extra text. I noticed a double colon in the `::root` selector—this looks like a typo; it should be just `:root`. I'll take care to preserve the correct indentation and width.
**Considering Indentation and Syntax Issues**

I see the file uses 2-space indentation. The `::root` selector appears, but I'm unsure if I should correct it to `:root`. I want to ensure I only change what's necessary. Their snippet uses `:root`, and adding tokens inside the existing `::root` could create discrepancies. However, if `::root` is already prevalent in their project, it might be okay to stay consistent. The user just asked to add tokens, not to fix existing issues, so I'll focus on that.
**Managing Token Updates**

I need to replicate the existing selector style while adding tokens to `freestyle-tokens.css`. The user is likely looking to append the tokens to the existing `:root` block rather than creating a new one. We must ensure these tokens are included, but some will be duplicates of existing ones. For example, the user's new specification for `ice-300` is a change, shifting from `#7FE1FF` to `#BFE7EF`. Additionally, they want to update the `brand-sheen` gradient using `aqua-500` and `mint-500`, and confirm existing tokens.
**Updating Token Values**

I need to confirm that the existing tokens are present and match the specified values. The snippet suggests some tokens already exist, like `petrol-600`, `canvas-100`, and `ink-900`, all matching their current definitions. However, `ice-300` needs updating to `#BFE7EF`. The user wants a "gentle ice," so I'll focus on that update. When presenting proposed changes, I should use Markdown code blocks for clarity. It might be best to display the updated `:root` block with the new tokens included.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Identifying variable conflicts**

I'm analyzing a file where many variables are already defined, like petrol colors and canvas. Notably, there's an ice-300 color defined as #7FE1FF, but they want to add a new ice-300 as #BFE7EF, which creates a conflict. This part is critical! They asked for new gradients for brand-sheen and brand-bullet, using some new colors like aqua-500 and mint-500. I'll need to reconcile these changes carefully and check for necessary updates in the token file.
**Deciding token formatting**

I need to determine whether to add these tokens within the same :root or under the existing ::root. The file currently uses ::root, so I should stick to the same indentation type and width. Upon reviewing, it looks like they consistently use two spaces for indentation when defining variables and comments. 

For instance, the format appears clear with two spaces before each variable and no extra spaces after colons in the token definitions. I should keep that formatting consistent throughout!
**Aligning token styles**

When adding tokens, I need to ensure I match the style with two-space indentation inside the :root. Tokens should not have a space after the colon, except for gradient values where the property: value should have one space. I noticed that while some variables follow the no-space rule, the user’s block includes spaces after colons, which deviates from the file’s style. Preserving the existing formatting is crucial, especially with the duplicate definitions for petrol, canvas, ink, and ice. I'll need to address those conflicts while confirming the user's instructions.
**Updating or confirming tokens**

I might need to replace the existing tokens with the new values or confirm their existence. The comment indicates these values are already referenced in index.html fallbacks, so if they already exist, I should ensure I keep those current values. However, there’s also the brand-sheen token, which they want to update to a new gradient. I'll need to clarify whether to update that one specifically or keep the existing definition intact.</details></think>

---

I'll update `freestyle-tokens.css` to add the requested tokens, adjust `--ice-300` to the new color, and update `--brand-sheen`, keeping the file's formatting and style consistent.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating CSS tokens**

I need to integrate changes into the existing :root block and merge definitions as necessary. I should start with a comment at the top, perhaps indicating that this is a new section. 

It looks like I’ll update several areas: for the Brand & Accents section, I should add petrol-500-a22, aqua-500, and mint-500. For gradients, I’ll revise brand-sheen using the new formula and add brand-bullet gradient. Lastly, ice-300 should now be #BFE7EF instead of #7FE1FF, noting the description emphasizing a “gentle ice.”
**Implementing CSS updates**

I need to maintain the existing mint-400 and add the new mint-500. It's essential to ensure comments are updated properly. I also want to keep formatting consistent, like ensuring there's no space after the colon, such as in `--petrol-600:#009090`.

So, I’ll change the definition for --ice-300 from #7FE1FF to #BFE7EF, insert new tokens for --aqua-500, --mint-500, and --petrol-500-a22. 

I'll update --brand-sheen and add the --brand-bullet gradient, placing them appropriately under the Brand & Accents section and including a comment for "gradient stops." Everything should be neatly organized!
**Preparing CSS patch**

I need to add petrol-500-a22 under the Brand & Accents section, with a comment “alpha utility.” I’ll also position the brand-bullet gradient in the gradient section right after brand-sheen, being careful to avoid any trailing whitespace.

Since I’ve already read the file, I'm ready to craft the patch. I’ll update line 25 for --ice-300 and adjust the brand-sheen gradient on line 29.

I’ll insert the new tokens (aqua-500, mint-500, and petrol-500-a22) appropriately after coral-500 and ensure I maintain the correct indentation. Let's get this sorted!
**Executing final checks and updates**

After applying the patch, I need to run the read_lints tool. Even though it may not be specifically configured for CSS, it should still work generically to return any linter errors. The rules suggest running it after editing, so I’ll go ahead with it.

It's likely that it won't return any issues. Plus, I need to provide status updates per the spec before and after each tool batch, adding those micro-updates. Finally, I’ll summarize the tokens added and values updated. Let’s proceed with the apply_patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing utility sections**

I’m considering including a "Utilities" section for petrol-500-a22, but it was requested to add everything to tokens-preview.html. That could mean adding it to existing sections like Brand & Accents. I think having a "Utilities" section with a swatch might be clearer. The swatch can use .color div to show background, especially for a more transparent color against white.

Also, they want to add brand-bullet gradient to the gradient section and maybe update the "Usage" code block to reflect new tokens. Creating todos for necessary edits might be a good idea beforehand.
**Managing task updates**

The task seems small, but I need to remember to create a todo list for multi-step operations even though we're encouraged to skip it for small tasks. The meta tool advises making a todo list for medium-to-large tasks, though.

I'm also required to include status updates before tool calls and run multiple tool calls in parallel when accessing files. Even though I read the file content earlier, I understand I can still apply a patch without re-reading if I provide the file through attached files. However, the tool does suggest re-reading before applying the patch.
**Planning file updates**

I need to remember that even though we have the content for tokens-preview.html from attached_files, I also should adhere to the strict rule about using the read_file tool since we last used it for freestyle-tokens.css. To stay compliant, I’ll call read_file for tokens-preview.html before applying the patch, even with provided content.

Before executing that, I’ll prepare a status update for clarity. The patch will include updating the ice-300 swatch value from #7FE1FF to #BFE7EF and adding aqua-500 and mint-500 swatches under Brand & Accents, ensuring mint-500 is placed after mint-400.
**Finalizing updates and sections**

I’m planning to add new swatches after mint-400 and ice-300, possibly before coral-500.

For the Gradient section, I'll update the brand-sheen value text to reflect the CSS gradient. While the swatch color style uses var(--brand-sheen), the displayed value needs updating to "linear-gradient(135deg, var(--petrol-600) 0%, var(--aqua-500) 42%, var(--petrol-500) 62%, var(--mint-500) 100%)". I’ll ensure it's clear for readability by mirroring the earlier style of using variables.

Additionally, I'll include a new gradient swatch for brand-bullet and consider creating a small "Utilities" section for petrol-500-a22 to maintain clarity.
**Implementing section updates**

I’m planning to add a "Utilities" section after Brand & Accents for a swatch of --petrol-500-a22. The section may not semantically include a utility, but it simplifies things. The alpha swatch will have a faint teal overlay on a white background, which works fine.

I'll make sure to update the ice-300 value to #BFE7EF and add aqua-500 and mint-500 swatches. The gradient values will also be updated accordingly. Since we must preserve indentation and follow status updates before tool calls, I’ll read the file and apply patches as per the plan. Afterward, I’ll run lints to ensure there are no errors.</details></think>

---

I'll open `tokens-preview.html` to update the Brand & Accents list with `--aqua-500`, `--mint-500`, fix `--ice-300`'s value display, add a Utilities section for `--petrol-500-a22`, and add/update the Gradient section with `--brand-sheen` and `--brand-bullet`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating token display**

I need to modify the tokens-preview.html to reflect the new tokens added to CSS, like aqua-500, mint-500, and petrol-500-a22. I should also update the ice-300 displayed value to its new hex code (#BFE7EF), add a brand-bullet gradient, and adjust the brand-sheen display value accordingly, using a human-readable string. Additionally, I'll need to update sections for Utilities, include swatches for --aqua-500 and --mint-500, and ensure everything is properly indented. I don't think tracking this with todo management is necessary since it’s just a single edit.
**Adding gradient and utilities sections**

I should add a new section called "Gradients," which includes the brand-sheen (with an updated text) and the brand-bullet. The existing gradient has just one swatch, so I can create another for brand-bullet and update the value text to reflect the new gradient string using tokens. Instead of showing the previous hex explicitly, it's better to display current gradient tokens. 

For the Utilities section, I can include the alpha color, ensuring to label it with the token name and textual RGBA string. I’ll keep the overall style consistent!
**Creating design patch**

I need to create a patch for the Brand & Accents grid, adding new swatches for aqua-500 and mint-500, placed after mint-400 and before ice-300. I’ll ensure to match the swatch structure of the existing blocks, using the background for var(--aqua-500) and var(--mint-500), with their respective labels and values (#1FAED9 and #35D1AE) aligning with the CSS token definitions.

Next, I'll update the ice-300 value to #BFE7EF. For the Gradient section, I'll change the value to the new gradient string for brand-sheen and create a second swatch block for the --brand-bullet gradient. Finally, I’ll add a new "Utilities" section with petrol-500-a22. I'll maintain proper indentation as observed in the existing file.
**Finalizing indentation for patch**

I’ve noticed the indentation in the code is consistent. For instance, lines 105-111 have 8 spaces before the `<div class="swatch">`, and the inner code seems to use 10 spaces. So, it appears there’s a base indent of 6 spaces, plus the extra for the inner elements. I'll copy an existing block for the new swatches, ensuring to have blank lines in between like the others.

I’ll keep an eye out for any linter errors since this is HTML. Now it’s time to apply the patch!</details></think>

---

I’m going to update `tokens-preview.html` to:
- add `--aqua-500` and `--mint-500` swatches,
- update the displayed value for `--ice-300`,
- update the `--brand-sheen` gradient preview text and add `--brand-bullet`,
- and add a Utilities section with `--petrol-500-a22`.

_**User (2025-10-13 23:07-0400)**_

can you add the different logos from @index.html like the one on the site vs inside the mockups

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering logo variations**

The index.html currently features a purple gradient for logos, while the feed-unified.html uses a petrol gradient for mockups. The user requested to incorporate different logos, comparing the one on the site to those inside mockups. A typical response could be to update tokens-preview.html to showcase these logo styles. Alternatively, I could modify the index.html to incorporate logo variations based on context—one for the site header and another for mockups. Overlays might be added to mock-up frames; however, the current setup lacks logo overlays.
**Clarifying logo styles**

The mention of '@index.html' indicates that the logo styles differ between the site and inside the mockups. The header on the site uses a purple gradient, while the mockups lack ‘sies’ text, possibly excluding it from the hero video overlay. The user might want to establish tokens for brand sheen gradient against the purple site gradient, defining CSS classes like `.logo--site` for the header and `.logo--mock` for mockup wrappers. They may also want to show ‘sies’ for the site and 'Proxi' for the feed mockups, and mixing brands might be acceptable for now.
**Clarifying logo implementation**

I need to add CSS classes and markup in index.html to display two different logos: the header will keep the .logo for ‘sies’, while I'll position an overlay for either ‘sies’ or ‘proxi’ inside the `.mock-inner` wrappers. The user asked to include different logos from @index.html, but we need to clarify where exactly to implement those changes. To address this, I plan to create a new section in tokens-preview.html called "Logos," featuring both styles: Site Logo (purple gradient) and Mockup Logo (petrol gradient). I'll define the necessary CSS for these classes, ensuring we reference the required tokens.
**Implementing logo styles**

In index.html, the variables `--g1` and `--g2` are set to specific gradient colors. However, tokens-preview relies on freestyle-tokens.css, which doesn't include these values. To maintain consistency, I can inline the gradient for the `.logo-site` class in tokens-preview's style or define custom CSS variables like `--site-g1` and `--site-g2`. The request specifies adding two different logos for tokens-preview, not index.html. So, the safest option is to add a new "Logos" section in tokens-preview.html, featuring "Site logo (Sies)" and "Mockup logo (Proxi sheen)." I'll use the appropriate gradient tokens for this update.
**Implementing logo styles with indentation**

I need to preserve the two-space indentation style in the file as requested. I'll add CSS rules for the `.logo-demo`, `.logo-site`, and `.logo-mock` classes within the `<style>` tag, placing the markup after the meta section or before the Neutrals section. The gradient tokens should exist, especially `--brand-sheen` for the `.logo-mock`, which will use that value as its background. For the site logo, I can replicate the existing gradient. 

I’ll create a new "Logos" section with swatch style boxes to display examples for 'sies' and 'proxi' logos. After implementing these changes around line 36 of the tokens-preview.html file, I'll run the linter tool again to ensure everything looks good!</details></think>

---

I'll add a new "Logos" section to `tokens-preview.html` with two examples: the site header logo style (using the gradient from `index.html`) and a mockup logo style (using `--brand-sheen`). I'll define minimal CSS classes in the page's <style> and insert the new section markup.

- Added a new Logos section to `tokens-preview.html`.
  - Site header logo: gradient from `index.html` (`linear-gradient(180deg,#F1DCE3 0%,#8B7F83 100%)`), label “sies”.
  - Mockup logo: uses `--brand-sheen`, label “proxi”.

You can tweak the text strings if you want them both to say “proxi” or “sies”; the styles are in `.logo-site` and `.logo-mock`.

_**User (2025-10-13 23:07-0400)**_

i also want the text tho..like the actual proxi word in those colors

---

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying logo text display**

I need to change the tokens-preview.html to show the word "proxi" in the specified color gradients, rather than just a filled block. The user wants the actual text in those colors. We’ve already set up some styles like .logo-demo for text fill color and .logo-site for gradients, but I need to update the text from "sies" to "proxi" to meet the user's request. This should let us render "proxi" in the desired style and colors.
**Ensuring text visibility and compatibility**

I need to ensure the logo's text displays correctly across browsers, which might require alternate shapes. The background-clip text trick relies on using -webkit-text-fill-color set to transparent, which we have already done. The user emphasizes they want the actual "proxi" word in the colors, so I'll propose adding a new class, .logo-word, for consistent letter spacing and possibly increasing the font size to 40-48 px from the current 32 px. I’ll update the first logo to show "proxi" and add toggles for both gradient styles.
**Implementing text changes**

I should add a fallback style to ensure text visibility in non-supporting browsers, like applying a color or duplicating the text as a background gradient, but I can focus on minimal changes right now. I’ll change the text from "sies" to "proxi". The user might want consistent letter spacing and weight, so the "proxi" in the mock feed uses the .logo class with a letter-spacing of -0.01em, which we've mirrored. I’ll update the first logo text in tokens-preview.html and confirm the label stays the same. Since this is small, I can skip the to-do list.
**Applying patches and updates**

I need to follow the tool-calling rules and include status updates before calling any tools—just like we did before. My plan is to run apply_patch to change the string and possibly add an aria-label or note for accessibility. I should also confirm that the gradient colors for the mockups are using var(--brand-sheen), which we've already updated, and the site header gradient comes from index.html. After applying the patch, I’ll run read_lints and then summarize the changes while inviting the user to adjust the text size if needed.</details></think>

---

I'll update the Logos section so the site header style also displays the word "proxi" using the site gradient, matching how you asked to see the actual word in those colors. Then I'll verify no lint issues.

- Updated the Logos section so both examples render the actual word “proxi” with their respective gradients:
  - Site header style: “proxi” with the site gradient.
  - Mockup style: “proxi” with `--brand-sheen`.

If you also want a “sies” variant, I can add a third card or a toggle.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Accessing gradient definitions**

I'm planning to quickly open the files to check the gradient definitions, which will help me pick the right hex stops. I'll use the function to read each file to get the gradient data I'm looking for. Let's make sure everything is in order before moving on! This should streamline the process of selecting hex stops for whatever project I'm working on.</details></think>

I'll quickly inspect the `proxi-twitter-*.svg` files to capture the exact gradients used in those logo examples, so I can mirror the colors on the "proxi" word in the preview. Then I'll update `tokens-preview.html` to add those two logo variants.
