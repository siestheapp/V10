# Database Information

The database contains TEST DATA ONLY for user1@example.com

## To Connect Locally

1. The backend uses the connection in db_config.py
2. All data for user1 is fake/test data
3. Feel free to read any data needed for testing

## Sample Data Characteristics

- user1 has random garments with inconsistent feedback
- Sizes don't make sense (3XL marked "too small", S marked "too big")
- This is intentional - created by random testing
- There are ~50-100 test garments
- Multiple brands and products

This should be sufficient for performance testing.
