# Database State & Roadmap - September 10, 2025

## 📊 Current Database Overview

**Database**: tailor3 (Supabase PostgreSQL)  
**Connection**: aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543  
**Latest Dump**: `database_dumps/tailor3_dump_2025-09-10.sql`  
**Total Tables**: 59 (vs ~20 originally documented)

---

## 🚨 Major Schema Changes from Original Documentation

### ❌ Outdated Structure
The original `database_schema.md` and `database_query_cookbook.md` are **OUTDATED**. Key changes:

1. **user_garments** table restructured:
   - ❌ REMOVED: `brand_id`, `category_id`, `subcategory_id`, `product_name` 
   - ✅ ADDED: `garment_id` (foreign key to new `garments` table)
   - ✅ ADDED: `measurement_set_id`, `garment_status`, `input_method`

2. **New normalized structure**:
   - `garments` table now holds product details (brand, category, product info)
   - `measurements` table for all measurement data (replaces old structure)
   - `measurement_sets` for grouping measurements
   - Many new views for denormalized access

3. **New feature tables**:
   - `try_on_sessions` & `try_on_items` - Try-on session tracking
   - `user_garment_feedback` - Detailed fit feedback
   - `fit_zones` & `user_fit_zones` - Personalized fit preferences
   - `feedback_codes` & related tables - Structured feedback system
   - `jcrew_product_cache` - Brand-specific product data

## 📋 Current Core Tables

### User & Garment Management
```
users                  → User accounts
garments              → Product catalog (NEW - centralized product info)
user_garments         → User's closet items (links to garments table)
user_garment_feedback → Detailed fit feedback
try_on_sessions       → Try-on session tracking
try_on_items         → Individual items in try-on sessions
```

### Brands & Size Guides
```
brands                → Brand information
categories           → Product categories
subcategories        → Product subcategories
measurement_guides   → NEW: Unified measurement guides
measurements         → NEW: All measurements (normalized)
measurement_sets     → NEW: Grouped measurements
measurement_types    → NEW: Types of measurements
```

### Legacy Tables (Still Present)
```
size_guides          → Old size guide structure
size_guide_entries   → Old size guide entries
size_guides_v2       → Transitional version
```

### Views (for easier querying)
```
garments_view
user_garments_full
measurements_simple
size_guide_entries_view
measurement_guides_view
feedback_complete
```

## 🎯 Current Application State

Based on the schema and recent commits:

1. **Try-On Logger** - Core feature implemented with:
   - Session tracking
   - Multi-item try-on support
   - Detailed feedback capture
   - iOS app integration

2. **Measurement System** - Evolved to:
   - Normalized measurement storage
   - Multiple measurement types per garment
   - Brand-specific methodologies
   - Dual unit support (inches/cm)

3. **Feedback System** - Sophisticated with:
   - Dimension-specific feedback codes
   - Feedback linkage to measurements
   - Confidence scoring
   - Fit zone tracking

## 🚀 Roadmap & Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Documentation Update** ⚠️
   - [ ] Create new query cookbook with working queries
   - [ ] Update database_schema.md with current structure
   - [ ] Document new relationships and views

2. **Data Migration**
   - [ ] Migrate remaining size_guides → measurement_guides
   - [ ] Clean up legacy tables once migration verified
   - [ ] Standardize measurement units across brands

3. **Feature Development**
   - [ ] Complete fit zone learning algorithm
   - [ ] Implement size recommendation engine
   - [ ] Build shopping recommendations based on fit preferences

### Architecture Decisions Needed

1. **Size Guide Structure**
   - Current: Mixed (old size_guides + new measurement_guides)
   - Target: Unified measurement_guides system
   - Migration path needs planning

2. **Measurement Storage**
   - Current: Normalized in measurements table
   - Consider: Performance optimization with materialized views
   - Balance: Flexibility vs query performance

3. **Feedback Architecture**
   - Current: Multiple feedback tables
   - Consider: Consolidation vs specialization
   - Priority: Maintain data quality for ML training

## 🔧 Technical Debt

1. **Legacy Tables** - size_guides, size_guide_entries need migration
2. **Inconsistent Naming** - Mix of singular/plural table names
3. **View Proliferation** - 20+ views may impact performance
4. **Unit Consistency** - Some brands have mixed inch/cm data

---

## 📝 Key Insights

1. **Database has evolved significantly** from initial design
2. **Normalization improved** with garments/measurements separation  
3. **Try-on tracking fully implemented** and operational
4. **Ready for ML integration** with comprehensive feedback data
5. **iOS app successfully integrated** with backend
