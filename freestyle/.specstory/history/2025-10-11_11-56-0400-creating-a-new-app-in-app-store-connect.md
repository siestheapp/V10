# Creating a new app in App Store Connect (2025-10-11 11:56-0400)

_**User (2025-10-11 10:55-0400)**_

wait i want to create a new app under my apple developer account so i can claim the app name even if i dont submit it yet. since i run the expo simulator through xcode, does it count as san xcode project? how do i do this

Step 1: Create an App Record in App Store Connect

Under “My Apps”, click “+” → New App.

Fill out the details:

Platform (iOS / iPadOS / etc.)

App name

Primary language

Bundle ID (this must match the bundle identifier in your Xcode project)

SKU (a unique internal identifier)

User access role (choosing who in your team can manage the app)

Save the app record.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Guiding on App Store Records**

I need to respond to the user's query about creating an app record in App Store Connect and the process of claiming a name. They’re asking if running the Expo simulator through Xcode counts as an Xcode project, so I’ll need to address that as well. 

It’s important to guide them on how to create a Bundle ID, explaining the differences between managed and bare workflows in Expo, along with EAS. Generally, the Bundle ID should be registered in the Apple Developer account before creating the app in App Store Connect.
**Clarifying Bundle ID Creation**

For an App Store app, you must have a specific bundle ID, and wildcards won't work. When creating a new app in App Store Connect, there's a dropdown for bundle IDs that are registered but not associated with any app yet, so you'll need to create it in the developer portal first. 

The bundle ID should follow a reverse DNS format, like com.yourcompany.yourapp. In an Expo managed workflow, you set the bundle identifier in app.json or app.config.js. I will need to check the relevant files for the specific project configuration.
**Checking Configuration Files**

I'm planning to read multiple files in parallel to gather the necessary information. I want to check `mobile/src/config.ts` or `mobile/expo-env.d.ts`, but my main focus is on finding the bundle identifier placeholder. I'll also take a look at the name in `mobile/package.json` to ensure everything matches up. I think I'll need to use the appropriate tools to facilitate this process and confirm the details effectively.</details></think>

---

I'll check your Expo project config to find or set the right bundle identifier we should register, then outline the exact steps to claim the app name and create the record.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying App Store Connect Process**

I need to address the user's inquiry about creating an App Store Connect App record and if running the Expo simulator through Xcode counts as an Xcode project. The `mobile/app.json` indicates `ios.supportsTablet` is true, but no `bundleIdentifier` is set. For Expo managed workflow, you need `ios.bundleIdentifier` in `app.json`. Running `expo run:ios` generates an Xcode project in an ephemeral sense, and you don’t need an uploaded build to claim an app name in App Store Connect; just create a Bundle ID.
**Outlining Bundle ID Registration Steps**

To create the App Store Connect app, I need to ensure that the Bundle ID is registered in the Apple Developer portal first. App Store Connect does allow choosing a Bundle ID from your Apple IDs list. If using EAS, it can handle registration during the build. Since the user wants to claim the app name now, here are the steps: 

1. Decide on a reverse-DNS Bundle Identifier and check its uniqueness.
2. Add it to the Expo config in `app.json`.
3. Optionally, set a display name for each platform.
4. Register the Bundle ID in Apple Developer under App IDs.
**Clarifying Registration and Expo Use**

I can use `npx expo run:ios` or `eas build` to auto-register the app. In App Store Connect, I need to navigate to My Apps, click on the + for a New App, and fill in the platform, name, primary language, bundle ID, SKU, and user access—making sure the app name is unique.

As for running the Expo simulator through Xcode, it doesn't count as an Xcode project needed for App Store Connect. An Xcode project isn't necessary; just having a registered bundle ID is sufficient for claiming the app name.
**Clarifying Bundle ID and App Name Requirements**

The Bundle ID must match what I plan to use later, but I don't need an Xcode project to claim the app name. It's important to note that the app name in App Store Connect must be unique across the store. As of 2023, while app names traditionally had to be unique across the App Store, Apple now allows multiple accounts to use the same name. This means I can reserve a name for 180 days after uploading the bundle, but uniqueness applies per account now. I'll have to be precise about these details!
**Creating an App Store Connect Record**

You can create an App Store Connect app record and claim the name without uploading a binary. The name is reserved for your account until you delete the app. Importantly, you'll need to select a Bundle ID, which you can add to your `mobile/app.json`:

```json
{
  "ios": {
    "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.freestyle"
  }
}
```

To answer the question about running the Expo simulator through Xcode, it doesn't count as a full Xcode project unless you've used `npx expo prebuild` or `expo run:ios`.

Steps to claim the app name:

1. Choose a Bundle ID and update `mobile/app.json`.
2. Register the Bundle ID in the Apple Developer portal.
3. Create the App Store Connect app record, fill in the fields, and save.

The Bundle ID must match your app's identifier, and while it should be unique, the SKU can be arbitrary. Also, if you're planning to use EAS, it can auto-register the Bundle ID, but it needs to exist beforehand to select it; the option to register a new Bundle ID is not available in App Store Connect.

Lastly, for platform selection, you can choose iOS; Apple has combined iPadOS under iOS. If you’re looking to verify, run `npx expo prebuild --platform ios` to ensure the Bundle ID matches what you're using.</details></think>

---

I looked at your Expo config: there’s no `ios.bundleIdentifier` set yet in `mobile/app.json`. You can reserve the app name in App Store Connect without submitting a build, and you don’t need an Xcode project for that. Running the simulator via Xcode doesn’t “count” as a project in Apple’s systems—it’s just local. What matters is picking and registering a Bundle ID, then creating the App Store Connect app record that references it.

### What to do
- Decide your Bundle ID (reverse-DNS), e.g. `com.yourdomain.freestyle`.
- Add it to your Expo config so your future builds match:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "Freestyle Mobile",
    "slug": "freestyle-mobile",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scheme": "freestyle",
    "orientation": "portrait",
    "userInterfaceStyle": "automatic",
    "splash": {
      "image": "./assets/hero1.jpg",
      "resizeMode": "contain",
      "backgroundColor": "#FAF8F6"
    },
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourdomain.freestyle",
      "supportsTablet": true
    },
    "web": { "bundler": "metro" },
    "experiments": { "typedRoutes": true },
    "extra": { "DEMO": true },
    "plugins": ["expo-router","expo-secure-store"]
  }
}
```

- Register the Bundle ID with Apple:
  - Go to Apple Developer → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers → “+” → App IDs → App.
  - Enter Description, the exact Bundle ID you chose, and any capabilities you’ll need (you can add more later).

- Create the App Store Connect app record to reserve the name:
  - Go to App Store Connect → My Apps → “+” → New App.
  - Fill:
    - Platform: iOS
    - App Name: your desired name (must be unique; if it’s taken, you’ll need a variant)
    - Primary Language
    - Bundle ID: select the one you just registered
    - SKU: any unique string (e.g., `freestyle-ios-001`)
    - User Access: as needed
  - Save. No build is required to reserve the name.

### Notes
- The Bundle ID is immutable once used; choose carefully.
- You don’t need to prebuild now, but when you do: `npx expo prebuild --platform ios` or `npm run ios` will generate an `ios/` project that uses the `ios.bundleIdentifier` you set.
- If you build with EAS later, it can auto-register the Bundle ID, but for creating the App Store Connect record now, you need it registered first to be selectable.

- Links:
  - Apple Developer (Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles): `https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list`
  - App Store Connect: `https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/`

- If you want, tell me the exact Bundle ID you’d like and I’ll verify it’s consistent across your config.

- I checked your `mobile/app.json` and found no `ios.bundleIdentifier`; I suggested the precise edit to add it so the App Store Connect record you create will match later builds.

_**User (2025-10-11 10:55-0400)**_

can you add 'XC com davey Proxy - com.davey.Proxy' as the bundle id. look at the screenshot of my existing bundle IDs. switching to agent so you can edit expo config

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing iOS Project Prebuild**

I need to prebuild the iOS project using Expo, specifically running commands in the terminal. The right directory for this is /Users/seandavey/Downloads/freestyle/mobile, and I should ensure I’m there before proceeding. To do the prebuild, I’ll run `npx expo prebuild --platform ios`, but I must note that I might need to request network permission since the tool runs in a sandbox without network access. I’ll also check if this is a multi-step task for further updates.
**Running iOS Project Prebuild**

The prebuild process will generate the ios/ directory and install necessary pods with `pod install`, which requires CocoaPods and network access. Since the sandbox might not have CocoaPods, the run could fail without the requested network. I need to consider the command structure, deciding between `cd mobile && npx expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install` and the one with installation. If needed, I can skip CocoaPods and generate the ios/ directory without them to still meet the user's request for an iOS project with the proper bundle ID.
**Executing Prebuild Safely**

I’m planning to run the prebuild command with `--no-install` to make things safer and handle pods later on my local setup. I’ll use the command: `cd /Users/seandavey/Downloads/freestyle/mobile && npx --yes expo prebuild --platform ios --no-install --non-interactive`. I want to make sure we don’t get any prompts, so I’m including `EXPO_NO_PROMPT=1` and using the `--non-interactive` option. Before proceeding, I need to check for network permission and provide a status update. There's no need for any TODOs for this step, so let's execute it!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying iOS project details**

I'm focused on finalizing the prebuild process. I need to summarize what I've done and think about the next steps. First, I'll verify the bundle identifier in the iOS project by searching for "PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER" using grep. I noticed Expo printed “icon not defined,” but that’s not a blocker. I plan to use multi_tool_use.parallel to run commands that list the directory of iOS, grep for both PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER and CFBundleIdentifier in Info.plist files. Let's get that going!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Summarizing next steps for user**

I need to respond to the user's request to "prebuild it." We've completed prebuilding and verified the bundle identifier, adding 'com.davey.Proxy' to app.json. 

Next, I’ll outline the steps: run `pod install` for local builds, open Xcode, set the signing team, and run on a simulator or device. I should also note an icon warning, suggesting they add an iOS app icon configuration. Finally, I'll provide commands for installing pods and open the iOS project for them. I'll keep the status updates in mind!
**Creating a todo list for tasks**

I realized we didn't create a todo list earlier, but the todo spec suggests that we should for multi-step tasks. Even though the steps were executed, I’ll add a todo_write function to track our tasks. 

I’ll include: "Set bundle identifier," "Prebuild iOS project," and "Verify bundle identifier in Xcode project," plus optional "Install pods." We can mark the first three as completed and propose adding "Open Xcode and set signing" as a next step. Let's compile this with the appropriate statuses!
**Finalizing tasks and addressing icon warning**

I see that I need to keep things concise. I'll create three tasks: "Add bundleIdentifier to app.json," "Prebuild iOS project," and "Verify bundle identifier in project," and mark all of them as completed. When the tasks are done, I’ll confirm that they’re checked off.

Next, I’ll note the icon warning. The user should add an icon to app.json or the assets folder and set the "icon" property under "expo" or "ios.icon." I’ll also provide brief instructions for opening the correct workspace file.
**Providing installation and code reference instructions**

I need to mention that running from Xcode may require pods, which could lead to build failures. I'll provide the command to install pods in the iOS directory: `cd mobile/ios && pod install`. If CocoaPods isn't installed, I'll suggest using `brew install cocoapods`.

Since we're not displaying code directly from the codebase except for changes to app.json, I can mention the path for Info.plist results. However, when showing the `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, I’ll include a minimal code reference block confirming one complete line instead of non-contiguous lines.</details></think>

---

I ran the iOS prebuild and verified the generated Xcode project uses your requested bundle identifier. I'll record the tasks and mark them complete.

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Add ios.bundleIdentifier to mobile/app.json
- [x] Prebuild iOS project to generate ios/ folder
- [x] Verify bundle identifier in Xcode project files

---

- Prebuild completed and `ios/` project generated.
- Confirmed bundle identifier is correctly set to `com.davey.Proxy` in:
  - `ios/FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (two targets)
  - `ios/FreestyleMobile/Info.plist` (via `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)`)

Next options:
- Install pods and open the project in Xcode to run on a device/simulator:
  - From `mobile/`: `npx pod-install && npx expo run:ios`
- Or build with EAS (recommended for distribution): `npx expo run:ios --device` or set up EAS builds.

Tell me if you want me to install pods and launch the app now.

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying app details**

I need to make sure we verify the Team if there are multiple teams in App Store Connect. For the bundle ID, the app type has to be "iOS," and it cannot already be used—meaning it must be unique. Wildcard IDs won't work, so I need an explicit app ID like "com.davey.Proxy." I should also check that it's not already associated with another app in Connect and belongs to the same organization as the team. The fix involves creating a new identifier with detailed steps in the developer portal.
**Refreshing App Store Connect**

I need to remind myself to refresh the App Store Connect page, as it can take a moment for changes to appear. If needed, I may have to re-open the "New App" form or log out and log back in. We can also choose to run EAS to auto-register the ID using terminal commands like "eas build:configure," but that requires Apple login, which isn’t ideal. Instead, I can suggest opening a Safari link for the user, who is on a Mac. Additionally, I should provide troubleshooting tips if "XC com davey..." gets created automatically by Xcode.
**Creating a new ID**

I’ve noticed that the new ID "XC com davey Proxy - com.davey.Proxy" can be generated by Xcode if the bundle ID is set in the project, with "Automatically manage signing" enabled. However, since they don’t have a prebuilt iOS project, we can open the `FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj` in Xcode, check the signing options, and set the bundle ID to create the ID if it doesn’t exist. But since they prefer not to do this manually, I’ll present two options: 

- Option A: Create it in the Developer portal manually.  
- Option B: Use Xcode to auto-create the ID.
**Updating App Store Connect**

Next, I want to guide the user to check App Store Connect, while mentioning that there might be a propagation delay. It's important to ensure they’re logged into the same Apple ID and on the correct App Store Connect team. We may suggest renaming the App ID to "com.davey.Proxy," but Apple prefers "XC com davey Proxy" as the description. I’ll instruct them to create it with that description. I should keep my response minimal and clear, provide a status update, and mention that the bundle ID won’t show until it’s registered on the Developer portal.
**Providing concise instructions**

Since we've already marked tasks complete, I don’t need to update anything. Here are the concise steps to follow:

1. The Bundle ID isn’t showing because it’s not registered with your team yet. The prebuild just sets local config.
   
2. Registration Steps:
   - In the Apple Developer portal: Go to Identifiers > + > App IDs > App; use the description "XC com davey Proxy" and Bundle ID "com.davey.Proxy", then register.
   - In Xcode: Open `FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj`, select target `FreestyleMobile`, check "Automatically manage signing," then set Bundle Identifier to "com.davey.Proxy." Xcode will create the ID.

3. Refresh App Store Connect; the new ID should appear, though it might take a moment. 

Note that bundle IDs must be unique in App Store Connect and case-sensitive; it’s safer to use lowercase letters.</details></think>

---

Short answer: it won’t show until that Bundle ID is registered on your Apple Developer account. Prebuild only updated your local project; it doesn’t create the identifier with Apple.

Two fast ways to make it appear:

- Manual (Developer portal)
  1) Go to Apple Developer → Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles → Identifiers → + → App IDs → App.  
  2) Description: “XC com davey Proxy” (any text).  
  3) Bundle ID: com.davey.Proxy (exact casing).  
  4) Continue → Register.  
  5) Go back to App Store Connect → New App, reload the page, and select it.

- Auto via Xcode
  1) Open `mobile/ios/FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj` in Xcode.  
  2) Target `FreestyleMobile` → Signing & Capabilities.  
  3) Select your Team, check “Automatically manage signing”.  
  4) Set Bundle Identifier to `com.davey.Proxy`.  
  5) Click “Try Again” if prompted—Xcode will create the App ID for you.  
  6) Reopen the New App form; it should appear.

Tips:
- Make sure you’re in the correct team in both Developer portal and App Store Connect.
- Sometimes there’s a short propagation delay; refresh/reopen the form.

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Providing Xcode guidance**

To help the user find the "Try Again" button in Xcode, I need to outline clear steps. They should open `FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj` or the workspace. If automatic signing is enabled and a provisioning profile or app ID isn’t found, Xcode will display a red "Fix Issue" button. For Xcode 15, the "Try Again" button could be in the issue popover, right next to the error message that says "Failed to register bundle identifier."
**Offering Xcode path steps**

To guide the user through Xcode, they should open `ios/FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj` by double-clicking it. In the navigator, they need to select the root of the project, followed by "Targets" and then "FreestyleMobile." Next, they should go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, ensuring the correct Team is selected. The "Bundle Identifier" should be set to com.davey.Proxy. If there are conflicts, they'll see a "Try Again" button either in the Issue navigator bubble or near the error message.
**Clarifying Xcode steps**

I can also mention the alternative option to use the Developer portal for manual registration. Since this is now a question, there's no need to update any TODO lists. I'll keep the answer concise. Here are the minimal steps to follow and how to trigger the "Try Again" option:

First, open the Xcode project `mobile/ios/FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj`. Then, select the project with the blue icon in the Navigator, followed by the target `FreestyleMobile`. Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab, check "Automatically manage signing," and choose your Team. Set the Bundle Identifier, hit Return, and if there's a red signing error banner, click the blue "Try Again" button. If it’s not visible, open the Issue navigator.
**Resolving bundle identifier issues**

When encountering the issue "Failed to register bundle identifier," a "Try Again" button will appear or in context when you click the issue. If that button doesn’t show up, here are alternative steps to resolve the problem:

- Toggle the checkbox for "Automatically manage signing" off and then on again.
- Temporarily change the Bundle Identifier and revert it back.
- Clean the build folder by selecting `Product > Clean Build Folder`.
- If needed, restart Xcode.

This should help get things back on track!</details></think>

---

- In Xcode, open `mobile/ios/FreestyleMobile.xcodeproj`, select the blue project, then target `FreestyleMobile` → Signing & Capabilities.
- Ensure Team is selected and “Automatically manage signing” is checked. Set Bundle Identifier to `com.davey.Proxy`.
- A red signing warning appears just under “Signing” with a blue button on the right. On Xcode 15 this button is labeled “Try Again” (older versions say “Fix Issue”). Click that button.

If you don’t see it:
- Open the Issues navigator (left sidebar triangle icon). Click the signing error “Failed to register bundle identifier …” and use the “Try Again” button shown in the detail pane.
- Toggle “Automatically manage signing” off → on, or retype the Bundle Identifier, to retrigger the prompt.

You can always bypass Xcode by registering `com.davey.Proxy` manually in the Developer portal, then reload App Store Connect.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Detailing signing process**

Alright, I can clarify this signing process. If the user wants to avoid changes, they can click "Cancel" on the recommended updates, which won’t affect signing. I should provide clear steps: first, direct them to click on the "FreestyleMobile" project in the navigator, then select the "FreestyleMobile" target to go to the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. I need to ensure they set the correct team, check "Automatically manage signing," and verify the Bundle Identifier is com.davey.Proxy. If there are issues, there are buttons for resolving them.
**Clarifying Bundle ID registration**

I can suggest registering the Bundle ID manually through the Developer portal so it appears in App Store Connect. We don’t need any tools or code changes here, and I want to keep my response concise. Following the developer "status_update_spec" isn't necessary since we're not using tools. I can instruct: "This prompt is unrelated; choose Cancel or Continue, as it won’t affect registration. I recommend Cancel now to keep the project clean. Then, go to Signing & Capabilities and click ‘Try Again’ to create the App ID." If they prefer, they can select "Perform Changes + Continue," which is also safe.
**Providing step-by-step instructions**

Let’s clarify how to handle the dialogs about updating settings and uncommitted changes. The user should choose to "Click Cancel" on both prompts since they are optional. 

Here’s the step-by-step path to get to "Try Again": 

1. Close the popups by clicking Cancel. 
2. In the left navigator, click the blue "FreestyleMobile" project icon. 
3. Select "FreestyleMobile" under Targets. 
4. Go to the Signing & Capabilities tab. 
5. Choose your Apple team. 
6. Check "Automatically manage signing." 
7. Set the Bundle Identifier as com.davey.Proxy. 
8. If a red "Signing" alert appears, click the blue "Try Again" button next to it. 
9. If you still don’t see it, open the Issue Navigator by clicking the triangle icon, select "Failed to register bundle identifier...", then click Try Again. 
10. Finally, return to App Store Connect and reload the page.
**Addressing potential pitfalls**

I need to cover some potential pitfalls regarding the registration process. First, the user must be logged into the correct team in Xcode Preferences under Accounts; otherwise, they won't be able to register. If the "Try Again" button never appears, it could mean the identifier already exists in another team, or that the user doesn't have an Admin/Agent role. 

In that case, they should register the identifier in the Developer portal. I'll reassure them that no additional actions are needed beyond this.</details></think>

---

Those popups are just “Update to recommended settings” and a git warning—not the signing prompt. You can safely Cancel both for now.

Do this to get the “Try Again” button:
- In Xcode, select the blue project `FreestyleMobile` → target `FreestyleMobile` → Signing & Capabilities.
- Team: pick your Apple team. Ensure “Automatically manage signing” is checked.
- Set Bundle Identifier to `com.davey.Proxy`.
- A red Signing error will appear under that section; on its right is a blue “Try Again” (older Xcode: “Fix Issue”). Click it to have Xcode create the App ID.

If you don’t see it:
- Open the Issues navigator (left sidebar triangle). Select “Failed to register bundle identifier …” and click “Try Again” in the detail pane.
- Confirm you’re logged into the correct team in Xcode > Settings > Accounts.
- As a fallback, register `com.davey.Proxy` manually in the Developer portal, then refresh App Store Connect.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Outlining response steps**

I want to respond concisely by breaking everything down into steps. First, it’s good that Xcode shows no issues, which means the App ID was created and provisioning worked. Next, I'll need to confirm its presence at the developer portal and provide a link. Then, in App Store Connect, I’ll refresh the list and search for "proxy". If it’s still missing, I'll suggest signing out and back in. If it’s not in the dev portal, I can guide on creating it manually.</details></think>

---

Looks like signing succeeded—no error banner means Xcode already created a provisioning profile and likely registered the App ID.

Do this to make it appear in App Store Connect:
- In Apple Developer → Identifiers, confirm `com.davey.Proxy` exists. If it’s there, the App ID is registered.
- In App Store Connect, the Bundle ID dropdown caches once the page loads. Close the New App page, go back to My Apps, click New App again, then search “proxy” in the dropdown.
- Ensure you’re on the same team in both places. If you have multiple teams, switch to the “Sean Davey” team in the top-left of App Store Connect.
- If it’s not in Identifiers, add it manually: Identifiers → + → App IDs → App → Bundle ID `com.davey.Proxy` → Register. Then retry the New App form.

Optional: if you prefer, we can switch the identifier to all‑lowercase (`com.davey.proxy`) to match Apple’s common convention, but `com.davey.Proxy` will work if it’s registered.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating app bundle identifier**

I need to change the bundle identifier in the Expo app.json to "com.davey.proxy" in lowercase. Plus, since the iOS Xcode project files are prebuilt from app.json, I'll also update the PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER in both the Xcode project and the Info.plist. Using something like sed would be best for automation, but I could also manually open and patch the files. Oh, and I should check the Podfile.properties.json for any iOS bundle identifier settings.</details></think>

---

I'll update the bundle identifier to lowercase in the Expo config and the generated iOS project so everything stays consistent. Then I'll verify the changes.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing app registration steps**

I’m considering the app registration steps and options for now. First, I want the user to sign in with Apple or push notifications. I’ll proceed to the New App page in App Store Connect and select the new bundle ID.

If I encounter an "Identifier not available" error, I’ll choose another ID. It’s also good to verify the Xcode team selection and the certificates. I’ll provide useful links and explain that Xcode may have used a wildcard provisioning profile.
**Clarifying provisioning profiles**

Under "Signing," I see that the "Provisioning Profile" is listed as an Xcode Managed Profile, indicating it might be a wildcard. This suggests that the App ID hasn’t been created yet, so I’ll need to add it manually. It’s essential to note that we’re currently using a wildcard profile, but App Store Connect requires a specific (non-wildcard) app ID, like `com.davey.proxy`. I’ll keep my reply concise and focus on this key point.</details></think>

---

You don’t have `com.davey.proxy` yet—that’s why it’s missing in the dropdown. Xcode is signing with a wildcard “Xcode Managed Profile,” which works locally but can’t be used to create an App Store Connect app. Add an explicit App ID:

- In Apple Developer → Identifiers (`https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list`), click the blue “+”.
- Choose: App IDs → App.
- Description: “XC com davey proxy” (anything you like).
- Bundle ID (Explicit): com.davey.proxy
- Capabilities: leave defaults for now.
- Continue → Register.

Then reopen App Store Connect → My Apps → New App (`https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps`) and pick `com.davey.proxy` from Bundle ID.

If Apple says “Identifier not available,” try another variant (e.g., `com.davey.freestyle.proxy`).

ok we got Proxey in the app store but i looked it up and there are no trademarks for Proxi so i think thats what i want to go with. change freestyle to proxi in all the mockups inside @iframe/

_**Assistant (gpt-5)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating mockups for branding**

I need to change "freestyle" to "proxi" in all the mockups within the @iframe/ directory. The provided path indicates multiple HTML files like closet-gallery.html, feed-gallery.html, and profile-screen.html that need updates. It's clear I should replace occurrences of "freestyle" in UI headers and title tags, ensuring they're formatted correctly. For instance, changing "Freestyle — ..." to "Proxi — ...". Casing is important too, so I'll be mindful of how "freestyle" appears in the logos.
**Clarifying branding changes**

I need to change "freestyle" to "proxi" in all mockups within the @iframe/ directory. This involves replacing the logo text in lowercase "freestyle," but I’m unsure if I should also adjust the title cases. They mentioned making changes across all mockups, including title tags like "Freestyle — Your Fit Feed," which should probably be "Proxi — Your Fit Feed."  The instructions specify "proxi" in lowercase, but their brand is "Proxi." I'll focus on replacing lowercase "freestyle" while keeping "Freestyle" as it is for now, though I feel a bit uncertain if that’s right.
**Preparing for updates**

I want to proceed autonomously with the task, but first, I’ll update the mockups by replacing the "freestyle" string in the HTML markup, particularly in the .logo elements and any instances in title meta tags like "Freestyle —". It’s clear I'll need to make edits across multiple files, so I should track those tasks with todo_write. To get started, I’ll list the files in the folder using list_dir to see what I’ll be working with.</details></think>

---

I'll update the branding in all HTML files under `freestyle-october/assets/iframe/` by replacing visible logo text and page titles to use "proxi". I'll make the edits now across those files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating occurrences carefully**

I need to ensure I only change text occurrences and not class names or comments while keeping the indentation style intact. My plan is to use apply_patch to update the files. 

I’ve noticed many instances of "freestyle" across titles and logos in various files. The user has requested I convert "freestyle" to "proxi," specifically using 'Proxi' for titles and 'proxi' for the logo. I’ll need to change any visible "freestyle" in logos to 'proxi' in lowercase as well.
**Deciding on the brand name casing**

I need to change 'Freestyle' in the title to 'Proxi' with a capital P for brand consistency, while considering the user's input of 'proxi' in lowercase. To be brand proper-case, I’m thinking 'Proxi' for titles and 'proxi' for the UI logo.

I should also update the alt text and check for any occurrences of 'freestyle' in CSS backgrounds. I’ll use grep to search for occurrences in the directory and then apply patches to update those files accordingly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating mockup files**

I need to change "freestyle" to "proxi" in the mockups. Specifically, the header logo text in `div class="logo">freestyle</div>` should be updated to "proxi" with a gradient style. I'm looking at several files: 

For `closet-gallery.html`, I’ll update the title at line 6 and check lines for the logo. Similarly, I’ll adjust the title and logos in `closet-screen.html`, `feed-gallery.html`, `feed-unified.html`, and check the `profile-gallery.html` for terms. We just need to preserve indentation during the changes.
**Modifying profile elements**

So, I need to change "Freestyle – Profile (Refined)" to "Proxi – Profile (Refined)." The brand letter currently shows 'F,' but since the request is to change "freestyle" to "proxi," I should consider updating that letter to 'P.' 

In `profile-gallery.html`, I found the brand letter within a div structure. If I keep 'F,' it'll reference "Freestyle," but it seems they want it to be 'P.' I'll also look at `profile-screen.html` for the same update. Additionally, in `size-twin-gallery.html`, I'll change the title and header logo.
**Updating brand references**

The user wants to shift from "Freestyle" branding to "Proxi." For the app tab showing "Proxy," I might update the title to "Proxi — Proxy," even though it feels a bit odd. I also need to change comments across the CSS from "Freestyle brand" to "Proxi brand." 

Right, I’ll look for instances where "freestyle" appears as a page header and update those. I'll execute the apply_patch on each file, ensuring I preserve indentation and use precise context lines. I've got the full contents already, so I can craft the necessary patches.
**Executing file updates**

Alright, here’s my plan for updating the files. In `closet-gallery.html`, I’ll change the title at line 6 and the brand comment at line 14 from 'Freestyle' to 'Proxi.' I'll also replace `<div class="logo">freestyle</div>` with 'proxi'. 

Moving to `closet-screen.html`, I’ll do the same with the title, comment, and logo. For `feed-gallery.html` and `feed-unified.html`, I’ll update titles, comments, and logos accordingly. 

Lastly, in `profile-gallery.html`, I'll switch the brand letter 'F' to 'P.' I’ll ensure all changes are done accurately!
**Finalizing branding updates**

I noticed we'll also need to change the comment 'Freestyle brand' to 'Proxi brand' throughout the files. For `profile-screen.html`, I’ll update the title, comment, and brand letter 'F' at line 562, like in profile-gallery.html. 

Additionally, I'll address some CSS body backgrounds that reference 'Freestyle brand' in comments. It’s important to edit only those occurrences and keep the formatting intact. I’ll use apply_patch to ensure all changes are accurately applied across multiple snippets.</details></think>
