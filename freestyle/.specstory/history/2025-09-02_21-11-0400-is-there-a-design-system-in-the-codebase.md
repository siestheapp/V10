# Is there a design system in the codebase? (2025-09-02 21:11-0400)

_**User (2025-09-04 01:11-0400)**_

do we have a design system in the codebase

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for design system indicators**

I need to determine if the codebase has a design system. This will involve investigating various elements like the Storybook configuration, tokens, CSS frameworks, and libraries like Tailwind. The repository is a static site without 'src' directories, so I won't make assumptions. Instead, I should use the codebase_search tool while following developer instructions closely. I'll start with a query about design tokens or component libraries at the root and consider checking the readme.md for more context.
**Running parallel tool searches**

I want to use multi_tool_use.parallel to conduct searches effectively by running several tools at once. I'll set up 3 to 5 tools simultaneously, including a broad codebase_search query, greps for terms like "tailwind," "bootstrap," "storybook," "design system," "tokens," "theme," and "components." Additionally, I’ll read the readme.md file for any relevant information. First, I’ll provide a status update before initiating these parallel searches for efficiency!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the repo to see if there's an established design system or component library (e.g., Storybook, Tailwind, tokens), and check the README for any mentions.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying design system details**

I need to clarify that there's no Tailwind, Storybook, or design tokens package found—grep returned none. So, my answer is: there's no formal design system, only page-level CSS variables, and the README mentions a /design directory that's missing. I might offer to set one up. While I should keep heavy formatting out, bullet lists are okay, with minimal bold for key points. Finally, I’ll include a status summary per requirements, since it's a read-only query.</details></think>

---

- **Short answer**: No formal design system exists in this repo.
- **What we do have**:
  - Page-level CSS variables acting as ad‑hoc “tokens” (e.g., in `index.html` and other pages).
  - An archived demo explicitly referencing “design system tokens.”

```8:13:archive/treemap-demo.html
    :root{
      /* Design system tokens you can swap */
      --color-bg:#FAF8F6;
      --color-ink:#2B2031;
      --color-accent:#8F6AAE; /* used to derive category tints */
    }
```

- **What we don’t have**:
  - No shared token file, component library, or Storybook.
  - No Tailwind/Bootstrap or a `/design` directory in this workspace (README mentions `/design`, but it isn’t present here).

If you want, I can extract the common tokens into a shared stylesheet (e.g., `styles/tokens.css`) and standardize usage across pages.

just extract them into an md file

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Extracting design tokens**

I see that I need to extract design tokens into a markdown file as the user requested. This means collecting CSS variables from files like index.html and others to create a list. It’s a pretty straightforward task, but still involves some steps. I should implement code changes using appropriate tools. The developer instructions say to provide status updates before tool calls, so I'll add a quick update while searching for tokens using grep to find the relevant occurrences. Let’s plan to scan all .html files for the ":root" variables.
**Compiling design tokens**

I need to use grep with the pattern "--[a-zA-Z0-9-]+:" to find all variables across .html files. Since the codebase is small, I’ll run grep across the workspace to ensure I get a complete extraction, even though we have some initial info from earlier. I’ll compile all tokens into a markdown file named DESIGN_TOKENS.md in the repo root, listing them grouped by file while unifying duplicates. The final file will maintain concise formatting using code fences. Before applying the patch, I’ll read the target file and then proceed to create it. Let's run the grep search for unique variables!
**Searching for additional tokens**

I should check the 'archive/' directory for any other files that might contain tokens, but there are many HTML files to consider. I'll use grep to look for ':root' blocks and maybe employ a parallel tool for efficiency. First, I'll grep for ':root' patterns to find relevant files before reading them to parse the actual token names. I'll also search for variable definitions using the pattern '--[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\\s:'. It’s also worth checking for CSS variables like var(--...) even if they aren't explicitly declared. After retrieving all this, I'll collate the results. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the HTML files for CSS variables and :root token blocks, then create a `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` at the project root with the extracted tokens grouped by page and a consolidated list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Extracting CSS variables**

I need to extract CSS variables from the :root blocks and save them into a Markdown file named DESIGN_TOKENS.md, as the user requested. It seems my task is to scan HTML files to locate variable definitions within those blocks. I’ll use tools like read_file and grep to get that done. Since I’m not executing code directly, I should create the file in my workspace, then use apply_patch to add the content properly. I’ll compose the content next.
**Identifying design tokens**

I found that the design tokens are defined in the :root sections of several HTML files. For instance, index.html has variables, and other files like closet-screen.html and closet-gallery.html share similar ones such as --bg, --ink, and --shadow. The grep tool indicates there are 17 files with :root blocks. I’ll need to read these files quickly, using read_file and grep to capture only the relevant lines around each :root block, focusing on the necessary context without going too far.
**Planning file reading**

I’m thinking about how to efficiently extract design tokens by either reading files directly and manually parsing them or using the multi_tool_use.parallel for faster access. Since there are 17 files, I’ll break them into batches of 3-5 as the guidelines suggest. My first batch will be index.html, closet-screen.html, closet-gallery.html, archive/treemap-demo.html, and feed-gallery.html. Next, I'll tackle profile-screen.html and others in subsequent batches, making sure to include status updates before each tool call. Plus, I could use regex to find unique variables while keeping context.
**Creating Markdown content**

I need to build a Markdown file titled "Design Tokens" and include a Consolidated Tokens list with unique tokens and their default values. While the user may want just the extracted tokens, I'll include per-file sections and a unique list at the top, which seems reasonable. I'll keep quoting to a minimum, and the summary will outline any changes. Since the guidelines suggest avoiding code output, I’ll focus on using apply_patch for adding the file. Let’s start with the first batch read.</details></think>

I'll scan the files containing :root blocks to extract CSS variables. Then I'll create `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` with a consolidated list and per-file sections.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Processing Markdown file creation**

I need to extract tokens and create a Markdown file called `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` in the project root. This feels like a small multi-step task since I’ll need to make todos for it. Even though it seems minor, I want to ensure I follow the proper process. I’ve already started scanning, and I should update the todo list. I included status updates before tool calls and will continue to do that for every step.
**Creating a todo list**

I need to reconcile the TODO list for my new file and code edit, even though it's optional for small tasks. The tool is quite insistent! So, I'll make a todo list with two items: "Extract CSS variables" and "Create DESIGN_TOKENS.md." I’ll mark the first task as in progress, then complete it after creating the file. Before that, I need to compile the tokens by extracting variables defined in :root across relevant files. I have reads ready for many files.
**Listing design tokens**

I'm compiling a list of design tokens from various HTML files. From index.html under :root, I have properties like background colors, ink, muted, accent colors, and shadows. In closet-screen.html and closet-gallery.html, there are similar variables, but I've noticed variations in naming, like 'r' instead of 'radius.' I also found that in feed-gallery.html, :root is mistakenly written as ::root, which might make some variables ineffective. Still, I can extract the useful tokens even without them all being present.
**Analyzing gradient colors and tokens**

The feed page uses hard-coded gradient colors but doesn't have the tokens I need. In the archive/treemap-demo.html, I can find tokens for background, ink, and accent colors. It looks like the archive/index3 files have the same tokens as index.html with :root variables. However, profile-screen.html and profile-gallery.html use ::root with different tokens. 

I see divergences in values across screens, like variations in ink and accent colors. My goal is to create `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` with a consolidated list based on the user’s request to simply extract tokens without standardizing.
**Organizing design token extraction**

I want to create a `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` file containing a heading for design tokens and an optional note about the data collection process. I’ll keep it concise by listing the :root values extracted from each file. It might be simpler to organize this by showing sections per file with the corresponding :root block in fenced CSS code blocks, preserving indentation and spacing.

For the extraction, I need to read additional files with :root or ::root to ensure completeness. I've already covered several important ones and have a few remaining files to check, so I’ll run the read_file function in parallel for those.</details></think>

---

I'll open the remaining HTML files with :root blocks to extract their token definitions, then create DESIGN_TOKENS.md with per-file sections including the exact :root content.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Organizing token extraction**

We need to create an MD file to extract tokens per the user's request to put them into DESIGN_TOKENS.md. I’ll follow developer instructions by tracking tasks with todo_write for any multi-step tasks. Since creating a file could count as a multi-step process—scanning and the actual file creation—I’ll create a minimal todo list stating: "Extract CSS variables into DESIGN_TOKENS.md" and mark it as in_progress, then complete it after the file is created. I'll ensure to compile tokens from all relevant files too!
**Gathering design tokens**

I’m extracting sets of design tokens from various files. From index.html, I have colors and shadows, including --bg, --ink, and --shadow. The closet-screen/gallery has similar tokens but renamed and missing certain elements like --track. I see a typo in feed-gallery.html with ::root that’s likely preventing proper application of variables. Profile-screen/gallery includes other tokens. Friends-screen has matching tokens with archive index replicating index tokens for consistency. There are also distinct names like --color-bg in treemap-demo. It’s a bit confusing with different naming conventions, but I’ll manage!
**Preparing token extraction**

I realize we don't actually need to open 2profile-copy, as it's unnecessary for our task. I’ll compile a section of consolidated tokens with unique variable names and their canonical meanings, noting any duplicates or differences. The user wants a simple extraction into an MD file. So, I’ll create a markdown document with tokens organized by file and include code blocks to show :root content. I’ll also provide a list of unique variables and common values while keeping everything minimal. Finally, I’ll prepare the content for DESIGN_TOKENS.md!
**Compiling design tokens**

I’m creating a document titled "Design Tokens" that includes consolidated tokens organized by category. For color tokens, I’ll list items like --bg, --ink, and --shadow. For radius tokens, I'll have variations like --radius and its alternatives. Then, I’ll include layout tokens like --space and --maxw, along with some miscellaneous ones. I want to note that the values vary slightly between files, but since the user just wants extraction, I’ll stick to presenting the exact :root content from each file without extra commentary. This keeps it clear and straightforward!
**Creating DESIGN_TOKENS.md**

I see that the user just wants to extract tokens into an MD file, not normalize them. I'll create DESIGN_TOKENS.md with sections for each file, including index.html and closet-screen.html, featuring their :root tokens. For feed-gallery.html, even though there's a typo with '::root,' I might leave that out since the focus is on extraction.

I’ll note duplicate tokens across files without bloating the document. It may be long due to 17 files, so I need to compile each :root block precisely and keep the MD as concise as possible while ensuring the needed content is complete. As for additional files like archive/index-interactive.html, I'll open those as well to get the tokens and use parallel processing where needed!</details></think>

I'll gather the remaining :root token blocks from a couple more HTML files, then create DESIGN_TOKENS.md with per-file sections containing those exact blocks.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning task execution**

We need to respond to the request about extracting items into a markdown file. First, I’ll create DESIGN_TOKENS.md in the project root, which will have the token lists extracted earlier. 

Since it’s a multi-step task, I'll set up a todo list—one item will be to extract CSS variable tokens from :root across files, and the other to create the markdown file with consolidated sections. The first item should reflect that we've started the extraction.
**Compiling token data**

I can compile tokens directly from the relevant files instead of outputting code to the user. For this, I’ll use the apply_patch or edit_file functions to create a new file. 

First, I need to extract the variables I've noticed. From the index.html file, I see tokens like --bg and --ink. The closet-screen.html has similar tokens with the addition of --border, while closet-gallery.html is almost the same but adjusts for some header spacing. Lastly, the archive/treemap-demo.html includes tokens like --color-bg. There's also an issue with feed-gallery.html where ::root is used instead of :root.
**Extracting and organizing tokens**

I need to compile the tokens I've gathered, like --bg, --ink, --muted, --accent, and others. For the profile-screen.html, I see multiple specific values for these tokens, including --bg with #1A1A1A and --accent-light with #E8DFF1. 

The profile-gallery.html has the same tokens, and other archive files like index3.html and 3profile.html also show similar values. I'll produce a markdown file with a title "Design Tokens" that includes a consolidated list of unique token names along with their common values.
**Structuring the markdown file**

The values for tokens can vary by file, so I think I can present a canonical default using the index tokens and then list alternate values observed. Since the user asked me to extract tokens into a markdown file, I’ll focus on that.

I'll create a DESIGN_TOKENS.md file with sections:  
1. An H2 titled "Consolidated token names" to list variable names across the repository.
2. Another H2 labeled "Tokens by file" that includes fenced code blocks showcasing the exact :root (or ::root) blocks for each file, limiting to just those token lines. That follows our earlier plan!
**Managing token extraction and file creation**

I need to ensure that I'm following METHOD 2 for code not in the codebase while creating a new file. I won't show content to the user, just a summary. I plan to use apply_patch to add the new DESIGN_TOKENS.md file.  

Before doing that, I’ll update the TODO list with tasks for extracting tokens and creating the documentation. It’s important to include micro-updates before tool calls. I’ll compile all relevant :root blocks, noting any typos like ::root. Finally, I'll create sections in the markdown file for consolidated tokens and individual file tokens, preserving formatting as needed.</details></think>

I'll create a small TODO list to track extracting tokens and writing the markdown, then generate `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` with a consolidated list and per-file sections showing each `:root` block.

- Created `DESIGN_TOKENS.md` at the repo root with:
  - A consolidated token set.
  - Per-file sections showing each `:root` block verbatim, including archive pages and profile variants.

Want me to also normalize `::root` to `:root` in those files and standardize token names (e.g., `--border` vs `--stroke`)?
