## 🔧 How It Works

When a user submits a J.Crew URL:

1. **URL Check** → Is it men's tops or outerwear?
   - ✅ Yes → Continue
   - ❌ No → Show error: "Only J.Crew men's tops and outerwear are supported"

2. **Product Fetch** → Get product details
   - Check cache first (instant)
   - If not cached, fetch from J.Crew (2-3 seconds)
   - Extract: name, image, sizes, price

3. **Try-On Session** → Start feedback collection
   - Product identified ✓
   - Sizes available ✓
   - Ready for user feedback ✓
