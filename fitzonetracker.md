# Fit Zone Tracker

**Purpose:** Document current calculated fit zones for database storage optimization

## Overview

Current fit zones are calculated dynamically from user feedback and garment measurements. This document captures the current state to prepare for database storage, avoiding recalculation on every analyze request.

## Fit Zones by Category

### Tops (Shirts)

#### CHEST
- **Zone Type:** Fit Zone (Standard/Tight/Relaxed classification)
- **Standard/Good Zone:** 39.5-42.5"
- **Current Classification:** Standard fit preference
- **Calculation Method:** Statistical analysis of "Good Fit" feedback (8 data points: Theory M 38", Lululemon M 39", Reiss L 40", Banana Republic L 41", J.Crew L 41", Faherty L 42")
- **Tight Zone:** ~36.0-39.5" (estimated from "Tight but I Like It" feedback)
- **Relaxed Zone:** 43.0-45.5" (calculated from loose garment boundaries with 0.5" separation from good zone)

#### NECK  
- **Zone Type:** Good Fit Range
- **Good Fit Range:** 16.0-16.5"
- **Fit Score:** 1.0 (Perfect)
- **Confidence:** 1.0 (High)
- **Data Points:** 4 garments with feedback
- **Calculation Method:** Range analysis from neck measurements with "Good Fit" feedback

#### SLEEVE
- **Zone Type:** Good Fit Range  
- **Good Fit Range:** 33.5-36.0"
- **Fit Score:** 0.889 (Excellent)
- **Confidence:** 1.0 (High)
- **Data Points:** 8 garments with feedback
- **Calculation Method:** Statistical range from sleeve measurements with positive feedback

## Algorithm Details

### Data Sources
- **User Garments:** 13 garments with chest measurements and feedback
- **Feedback Types:** "Good Fit", "Tight but I Like It", "Loose but I Like It", "Slightly Loose"
- **Brands:** Theory, Lululemon, Reiss, Banana Republic, J.Crew, Faherty, NN.07, Patagonia
- **Size Range:** S to XL

### Calculation Methods

#### Chest (Fit Zone Method)
```
Good Fit Measurements: 38", 38", 39", 40", 41", 41", 41", 42"
Statistical Center: ~40.1"
Standard Deviation: ~1.5"
Standard Zone: 40.1 ± (0.5 × 1.5) = 38.85-41.35" → Rounded to 39.5-42.5"
```

#### Neck & Sleeve (Good Fit Range Method)
```
Neck: Direct range from feedback measurements (16.0-16.5")
Sleeve: Direct range from feedback measurements (33.5-36.0")
```

## Database Storage Plan

### Proposed Table: `user_fit_zones`
```sql
- user_id (int)
- category_id (int) 
- dimension (text)
- zone_type (text) -- 'fit_zone' or 'good_fit_range'
- tight_min, tight_max (decimal)
- good_min, good_max (decimal)  
- relaxed_min, relaxed_max (decimal)
- confidence (decimal)
- data_points (int)
- last_calculated (timestamp)
- calculation_method (text)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create database table** for storing calculated fit zones
2. **Implement caching mechanism** to store zones after calculation
3. **Add invalidation logic** when new feedback is added
4. **Extend to other categories** (Pants, etc.) as data becomes available
5. **Add recalculation triggers** based on significant feedback changes

## Notes

- Current zones based on Tops category only
- Chest uses fit zone methodology (tight/standard/relaxed)
- Neck and sleeve use good fit range methodology
- All measurements are in inches
- Zones are rounded to 0.5" increments for practical shopping
- **Zone Overlap Issue Identified:** Original calculation showed relaxed zone as 42.0-45.5", overlapping with good zone (39.5-42.5"). Corrected to 43.0-45.5" with proper 0.5" separation
- One known data quality issue: NN.07 M has conflicting feedback (correction needed)
