**Note:** All timestamps are in US Eastern Time (EST/EDT).

## [2025-06-29 23:36] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- **Consolidated tailor3 files:** Moved all tailor3 files from `tailor3/` directory to `supabase/` directory for better organization
- **Created comprehensive schema documentation:** Generated `TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` with complete table definitions, constraints, and relationships based on latest clean schema dump
- **Fixed snapshot system:** Updated `scripts/db_snapshot.py` to connect to Supabase tailor3 database instead of local database
- **Resolved connection issues:** Updated database configuration to use Supabase pooled connection (aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:6543)
- **Fixed table references:** Updated all table names and columns to match actual tailor3 schema (e.g., `user_fit_feedback` → `user_garment_feedback`)
- **Created working snapshots:** Successfully generated JSON and Markdown snapshots of tailor3 database with sample data
- **Organized snapshot structure:** Created `supabase/snapshots/2025-06-29/` directory with organized snapshot files
- **Cleaned up failed attempts:** Removed earlier failed snapshot files that were connecting to wrong database
- **Committed changes:** Added all changes to Git with comprehensive commit message

**Files created/updated:**
- `supabase/TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` - Complete schema documentation
