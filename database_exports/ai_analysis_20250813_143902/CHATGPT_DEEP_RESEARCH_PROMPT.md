# ChatGPT Deep Research Prompt: Database Schema Optimization

## üéØ MISSION

You are a senior database architect tasked with analyzing and optimizing a **clothing fit analysis system's measurement storage architecture**. The system has evolved into a **dual-schema predicament** that needs resolution.

## üìÅ ANALYSIS PACKAGE PROVIDED

I'm providing you with a complete database analysis package containing:
- **`database_analysis.json`** - Complete technical schema analysis
- **`schema_dump.sql`** - Full PostgreSQL schema 
- **`data_samples.sql`** - Sample data from all measurement tables
- **`analysis_summary.md`** - Key findings summary
- **`AI_AGENT_BRIEFING.md`** - Executive briefing (read this first!)

## üö® THE CORE PREDICAMENT

### **Problem: Dual Measurement Storage Systems**

The system currently operates **TWO PARALLEL** approaches for storing the same conceptual data:

#### **Approach 1: Traditional (Legacy)**
```sql
-- Body measurements (what size fits a person)
brands ‚Üí size_guides ‚Üí size_guide_entries
-- Garment specifications (actual garment dimensions)  
brands ‚Üí garment_guides ‚Üí garment_guide_entries
```

#### **Approach 2: Unified (New - August 2025)**
```sql
-- Everything in one table
brands ‚Üí garments ‚Üí measurements
```

### **Current Data Distribution**
- **169 measurements** in unified table (including new Uniqlo shirt)
- **67 size guide entries** in traditional system
- **15 garment guide entries** in traditional system
- **Inconsistent usage**: New products being added to different systems

## üîç SPECIFIC QUERY PERFORMANCE ISSUES

### **Issue 1: Complex Size Guide Lookups**
Current pattern used throughout the system:
```sql
-- This query pattern appears in 5+ places with variations
SELECT sge.* FROM size_guides sg
JOIN size_guide_entries sge ON sg.id = sge.size_guide_id
WHERE sg.brand_id = %s AND sg.category_id = %s AND sg.gender = %s 
AND sg.fit_type = %s AND sge.size_label = %s
-- Often with additional fallback logic:
-- Try subcategory-specific ‚Üí category-level ‚Üí fit_type fallbacks
```

**Problems:**
- Complex nested fallback logic repeated in multiple files
- No caching of guide lookups
- Multiple JOINs required for simple lookups

### **Issue 2: Feedback Query Performance Nightmare**
From `simple_multi_dimensional_analyzer.py` (lines 159-224):
```sql
-- üö® PERFORMANCE KILLER: 6+ subqueries per garment
SELECT 
    ug.id, b.name, ug.product_name, ug.size_label,
    sge.chest_min, sge.chest_max, sge.chest_range,
    -- 6 EXPENSIVE SUBQUERIES (one per dimension):
    COALESCE(
        (SELECT fc.feedback_text FROM user_garment_feedback ugf 
         JOIN feedback_codes fc ON ugf.feedback_code_id = fc.id 
         WHERE ugf.user_garment_id = ug.id AND ugf.dimension = 'chest' 
         ORDER BY ugf.created_at DESC LIMIT 1),
        (SELECT fc.feedback_text FROM user_garment_feedback ugf 
         JOIN feedback_codes fc ON ugf.feedback_code_id = fc.id 
         WHERE ugf.user_garment_id = ug.id AND ugf.dimension = 'overall' 
         ORDER BY ugf.created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
    ) as chest_feedback,
    -- ... REPEAT FOR neck, sleeve, waist, hip (5 more subqueries)
FROM user_garments ug
JOIN brands b ON ug.brand_id = b.id
LEFT JOIN size_guide_entries sge ON ug.size_guide_entry_id = sge.id
```

**Performance Impact:**
- **100ms+ per garment** due to 6+ subqueries
- Query executed for every size recommendation
- No materialized views or caching

### **Issue 3: Dual System Query Confusion**
Different parts of the system query different tables for the same data:

**Size recommendations** (body measurements):
```sql
-- Uses traditional size_guides approach
SELECT chest_min, chest_max FROM size_guide_entries sge
JOIN size_guides sg ON sge.size_guide_id = sg.id
WHERE sg.brand_id = ? AND sge.size_label = ?
```

**Garment specifications** (actual garment dimensions):
```sql
-- New Uniqlo shirt uses unified measurements table
SELECT min_value, max_value FROM measurements
WHERE brand_id = ? AND size_label = ? AND measurement_type = 'chest'

-- Old NN07 shirt uses traditional garment_guides approach  
SELECT measurement_value FROM garment_guide_entries gge
JOIN garment_guides gg ON gge.garment_guide_id = gg.id
WHERE gg.brand_id = ? AND gge.size_label = ?
```

## üìä CURRENT SYSTEM CONTEXT

### **Business Requirements**
- **Primary use case**: Given user's body measurements/fit preferences, find best size across brands
- **Performance target**: <100ms per garment analysis
- **Scale**: 10+ brands, 100+ products, 1000+ size combinations
- **Data types**: Both body measurements (ranges) and garment specifications (exact values)

### **Technical Constraints**
- PostgreSQL 15 (Supabase hosted)
- Python FastAPI backend
- iOS Swift frontend
- Must maintain backward compatibility during migration

### **Current Performance Issues**
- Feedback queries: **100ms+ per garment** (6+ subqueries)
- Size guide lookups: Complex fallback logic with multiple JOINs
- Data fragmentation: Same conceptual data in multiple tables
- No query caching or materialized views for common patterns
