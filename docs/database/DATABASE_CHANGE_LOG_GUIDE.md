A **simple log file** that automatically tracks every database change in plain English. No need to hunt through Supabase tables to see what changed!

**Location**: `logs/database_changes.log`

## ðŸ“– **How to Review Changes**

### **Option 1: Open the Log File (Easiest)**
1. In Cursor, open `logs/database_changes.log`
2. Scroll to the bottom to see recent changes
3. Each change shows:
   - **Time** it happened
   - **What table** was changed
   - **What changed** (before/after)
   - **Why** it was changed

### **Option 2: Terminal Commands (If You Want)**
```bash
# See the last 20 changes
tail -20 logs/database_changes.log

# See all changes from today
grep "2025-08-08" logs/database_changes.log

# Search for specific changes (like "Lacoste")
grep "Lacoste" logs/database_changes.log

# See everything
cat logs/database_changes.log
```

## ðŸ”„ **How Changes Get Logged**

**You don't need to do anything!** 

When I (the AI assistant) make database changes, I automatically:
1. âœ… Log what I'm about to change
2. âœ… Make the database change
3. âœ… Log what actually changed
4. âœ… Add timestamps and descriptions

**Example log entry:**
```
[15:53:03] INSERT: brands
Details: Added French luxury brand with international sizing - Added new record
New Data: Lacoste (ID: 11) - France region, French sizing (42=L), dual measurements
----------------------------------------
```
