# Research Documentation

This directory contains research documents, analysis, and planning materials for the V10 project.

## Research Documents

### **measurement_analysis.md**
- **Purpose:** Analysis of user fit preferences and measurement interpretation
- **Key Insights:** 
  - User fit range analysis (36" to 47" chest)
  - Fit category misinterpretation ("Tight but I Like It" vs "too tight")
  - Algorithm improvement recommendations
- **Status:** Research findings ready for implementation

### **RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md**
- **Purpose:** Planning document for the garment recommendation system
- **Content:** 
  - System architecture planning
  - Algorithm design considerations
  - Implementation roadmap
- **Status:** Planning document for future development

## Research Areas

### **Fit Preference Analysis**
- Understanding user fit ranges
- Distinguishing between intentional vs uncomfortable fits
- Algorithm improvements for better recommendations

### **Recommendation System Design**
- System architecture planning
- Algorithm design and optimization
- User experience considerations

## Implementation Status

- **measurement_analysis.md:** Insights identified, ready for algorithm updates
- **RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md:** Planning phase, implementation pending

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate fit preference insights** into the current fit calculation algorithm
2. **Update feedback system** to capture nuanced fit preferences
3. **Implement recommendation system** based on planning documents
4. **Test and validate** improvements with user feedback

## Notes

- Research findings should be integrated into the active codebase
- These documents serve as reference for ongoing development
- Regular updates needed as new insights are discovered
