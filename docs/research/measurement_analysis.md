### Initial Analysis of Fit Categories
Originally misinterpreted Theory S (36-38") as "too tight" rather than "Tight but I Like It", which led to an important distinction in how we understand fit preferences.

### Corrected Fit Analysis
1. **Theory S (36-38")**: "Tight but I Like It"
   - This is an intentionally tight fit you enjoy
   - Not uncomfortable, but fitted
   - Lower bound of your acceptable range

2. **Lululemon M (39-40")**: "Good Fit"
   - Your baseline "perfect fit"
   - Middle of your preferred range
   - Most reliable reference point

3. **BR L (41-44")**: No feedback yet
   - Falls between your "good" and "loose but like it" range
   - Could be valuable data point once you provide feedback

4. **Patagonia XL (47")**: "Loose but I Like It"
   - Intentionally loose fit you enjoy
   - Not too loose, since you like it
   - Upper bound of your acceptable range

### Key Realizations
- User comfortable with (and enjoys) a range from 36" (fitted) to 47" (loose)
- "Sweet spot" is around 39-40"
- User has flexibility in preferences - can enjoy both fitted and loose fits
- Previous algorithm needs updating to treat "Tight but I Like It" as a valid preference point, not a negative data point

### Pending Questions
Would you like me to:
1. Update the calculation algorithm to reflect these preference distinctions?
2. Create a way to track different fit preferences for different types of garments (since you might want different fits for different occasions)?
3. Modify the feedback system to better capture these nuanced preferences?

### Implementation Impact
This understanding should change how we:
- Weight measurements in our calculation
- Interpret "Tight but I Like It" feedback
- Consider the full range of acceptable fits
- Design the feedback system to capture intentional fit preferences
