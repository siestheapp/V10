## Supabase Database Docs

This directory documents the Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL database used by V10 ("tailor3"). It focuses on schema, queries, and evolution â€” not raw SQL dumps.

- See `operations.md` for connection/env details and tooling
- See `schema_overview.md` for the current model vs deprecated pieces
- See `key_tables.md` for concise table-level references
- See `query_reference.md` for common queries used in the codebase
- See `schema_evolution.md` for change history and snapshot pointers
