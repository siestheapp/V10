# V10 iOS Performance Optimization

## Quick Start

1. **Open iOS project**:
   ```bash
   cd src/ios_app
   open V10.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Build and run** - The app is already configured to use our test backend at:
   ```
   https://v10-2as4.onrender.com
   ```
   No need to run anything locally!

3. **Test with user1 account**
   - This account has random test data
   - Data is intentionally inconsistent (3XL too small, S too big, etc.)
   - This is fake data created by random button clicking

## Performance Issues to Fix

Current performance:
- Tab switching: ~450ms (target: <200ms)
- Scrolling: ~20 FPS (target: 55+ FPS)  
- Button taps: ~350ms (target: <100ms)

## What You Have

- Full iOS source code
- Backend API source
- Test database with fake user1 data
- All product/brand data

## What's Missing

- Web scrapers (proprietary, not needed for performance)
- Production credentials (not needed)

## Focus Areas

1. SwiftUI view performance
2. List/Grid scrolling optimization
3. Image loading and caching
4. Tab switching animations
5. Form responsiveness
