## Technical Implementation

### Working Scripts
1. **`check_missing_jcrew_shirts.py`** - Selenium-based scraper with anti-detection
2. **`jcrew_full_product_extractor.py`** - Playwright-based enhanced scraper

Both scripts:
- Handle J.Crew's anti-scraper protection
- Properly click "Load More" buttons
- Extract from both HTML and JavaScript data
- Deduplicate color variants automatically
- Generate detailed reports

### Key Insights
- J.Crew treats color variations as separate products in their UI
- Product codes follow pattern: 2 letters + 3-4 digits (e.g., BE996, CM389)
- The site uses heavy JavaScript rendering and lazy loading
- Must click "Load More" multiple times to get all products

## Next Steps
1. Use `JCrewProductFetcher` to fetch detailed data for the 28 missing products
2. Add them to the database using existing ingestion scripts
3. Set up scheduled job to regularly check for new products

## Files Generated
- `scripts/jcrew_products_full.csv` - All extracted products
- `scripts/jcrew_products_clean.csv` - Filtered valid product codes
- `scripts/jcrew_products_full.json` - Detailed JSON data
- `jcrew_missing_shirts_*.json` - Missing products reports
