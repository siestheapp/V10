# J.Crew Fit Options Fix - V10 App

## Issue
The app was showing fit type options (Tall, Classic) for J.Crew products that don't actually have fit variations. For example, the "Fine-wale corduroy shirt with embroidered dogs" was showing fit options in the app, but the actual product page only has one fit ("Regular fit").

## Root Cause
The `jcrew_fetcher.py` was extracting fit options from JSON metadata in the page's script tags. These were generic J.Crew fit types that appeared in the page's structured data but weren't actually selectable options for the specific product.

## Solution
Modified `src/ios_app/Backend/jcrew_fetcher.py`:

1. **Disabled unreliable JSON extraction** (lines 647-673):
   - Commented out the method that extracted fit options from script tags
   - This method was finding fits in metadata that weren't actually available

2. **Added UI element validation** (lines 781-803):
   - Now checks for actual fit selection UI elements on the page
   - Only returns fit options if there are real buttons/selectors present
   - Still requires multiple fit options (2+) to consider them valid

## Code Changes
```python
# Before: Would extract fits from JSON even without UI
fit_urls = re.findall(r'fit=([^&"]*)', script_content)
if fit_urls:
    for fit in fit_urls:
        fit_options.append(fit)

# After: Requires actual UI elements
actual_fit_selectors = soup.select(
    'button[data-testid*="fit"], '
    'button[aria-label*="fit"], '
    '.fit-selector button, '
    '[data-fit-type], '
    '.product__fit-option, '
    '[data-qaid*="fitOption"]'
)

if not actual_fit_selectors:
    print(f"ðŸš« No fit selection UI found on page. Not returning fit options")
    return []
```

## Testing
Tested with the problematic URL:
- Before fix: Returned ['Tall', 'Classic']
- After fix: Returns [] (empty list)

The app will no longer show fit selection options when they don't actually exist on the product page.

## Result
Users will only see fit type selection in the app when the product actually has multiple fit options available on the J.Crew website.
