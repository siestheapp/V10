# Single Color Display Fix - V10 App

## Issue
When a J.Crew product only had one color option (like the "Fine-wale corduroy shirt with embroidered dogs" in Dog Emb Blue Brown), the app wasn't displaying the color at all. It was auto-selecting it behind the scenes but not showing it to the user.

## Why This Matters
Even with a single color option, it's important to show what color the user is trying on for:
- **Clarity** - Users should know exactly what variant they're providing feedback on
- **Confirmation** - Seeing the color confirms they have the right product
- **Consistency** - All product attributes should be visible, even if not selectable
- **Future Reference** - When viewing try-on history, the color should be clear

## Solution
Modified `src/ios_app/V10/Views/Fit Feedback/TryOnConfirmationView.swift`:

### 1. Changed Color Section Display Logic (lines 178-187)
```swift
// Before: Only showed colors when count > 1
if availableColorOptions.count > 1 {

// After: Show colors whenever they exist
if !availableColorOptions.isEmpty {
```

### 2. Updated UI Text for Single vs Multiple Colors
- Single color: Shows "Color" and "You're trying on:"
- Multiple colors: Shows "Select Color" and "Which color are you trying on?"

### 3. Made Single Color Swatches Non-Interactive
```swift
.disabled(availableColorOptions.count == 1)
```
- Single color swatch appears selected but can't be changed
- Multiple colors remain selectable as before

### 4. Kept Auto-Selection Logic
- Single colors are still auto-selected in `onAppear`
- Continue button doesn't require color selection for single colors

## Result
- Users now see the color they're trying on, even when it's the only option
- The color appears as a pre-selected, disabled swatch
- The UI clearly indicates what color variant is being tried on
- Better user experience with full transparency about product details
