# Product Image Grey Padding Fix - V10 App

## Issue
Product images in the TryOnConfirmationView were showing grey padding bars on the top and bottom. This was happening with J.Crew product images like the "Broken-in organic cotton oxford shirt".

## Root Cause
The app was forcing all product images into a 3:4 aspect ratio (height = width Ã— 1.25), but J.Crew product images are typically square (1:1) or have varying aspect ratios. The `.aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)` was maintaining the image's natural proportions, causing grey bars to fill the extra space.

## Solution
Modified `src/ios_app/V10/Views/Fit Feedback/TryOnConfirmationView.swift` (lines 83-101):

### Before:
```swift
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
.frame(height: UIScreen.main.bounds.width * 1.25) // Forces 3:4 aspect ratio
.background(Color(.systemGray6)) // Creates grey background
```

### After:
```swift
.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
// No fixed height - image maintains its natural aspect ratio
// No background color - removes grey padding
```

## Changes Made:
1. **Removed fixed height constraint** - No more `frame(height:)` forcing 3:4 ratio
2. **Removed grey background** - No more `.background(Color(.systemGray6))`
3. **Added square placeholder** - Loading state shows square aspect ratio
4. **Let image be flexible** - Image now displays at its natural aspect ratio

## Result:
- Product images display without any grey padding
- Square images remain square
- Portrait images display as portrait
- Landscape images display as landscape
- Full width is maintained, height adjusts automatically
- Clean, professional appearance matching e-commerce standards
