# Aug 8 - AI-Driven Logic Extraction Approach

## The Problem
Current fit recommendation system has hardcoded logic that doesn't match user's actual preferences:
- Theory M shirts (38-40" chest) marked as "Good Fit" but classified as "tight" by system
- Fit zone boundaries (39.5-42.5" for "good") don't reflect real user preferences (38-44")
- System is too rigid and doesn't learn from contradictions

## The Solution: AI as Research Tool

### Phase 1: AI Training Period
- Replace current hardcoded logic with AI agent for all recommendations
- AI receives complete user fit profile:
  ```
  User Fit Profile:
  - Theory M: 38-40" chest, "Good Fit" (polo)
  - BR L: 41-44" chest, "Good Fit" (t-shirt) 
  - J.Crew L: 41-43" chest, "Good Fit" (oxford)
  - Lululemon M: 39-40" chest, "Good Fit" (athletic)
  - Reiss L: 40" chest, "Good Fit" (dress shirt)
  - Faherty L: 42-44" chest, "Good Fit" (casual)
  
  Neck Measurements:
  - Theory M: 15-15.5" neck, "Good Fit"
  - BR L: 16-16.5" neck, "Good Fit"
  - J.Crew L: 16-16.5" neck, "Good Fit"
  
  Sleeve Measurements:
  - Theory M: 34-34.5" sleeve, "Good Fit"
  - BR L: 35" sleeve, "Good Fit"
  - J.Crew L: 34.5-35" sleeve, "Good Fit"
  
  Subcategory Patterns:
  - T-shirts: Prefer L (BR, J.Crew)
  - Polos: Prefer M (Theory)
  - Dress shirts: Prefer L (Reiss)
  - Athletic: Prefer M (Lululemon)
  
  Brand-Size Patterns:
  - Theory: M preferred
  - BR: L preferred  
  - J.Crew: L preferred
  ```

- AI learns user's actual preferences through trial and feedback
- Collects dataset of "AI decisions + user outcomes"

### Phase 2: Logic Extraction
- Ask AI: "Based on all our interactions, what rules/code would produce the same recommendations?"
- AI generates:
  - Dynamic fit zone boundaries
  - Weighting systems
  - Decision logic
  - Brand-specific patterns
  - Subcategory preferences

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Implement AI-extracted logic in traditional code
- Validate against AI recommendations
- Deploy fast, reliable system with learned preferences

## Benefits

### 1. AI Learns Real Preferences
- Discovers that "tight" zone should start at 38.0" not 39.5"
- Learns brand-specific sizing quirks
- Understands subcategory-based preferences
- Handles contradictions (Theory M marked "Good Fit" despite tight classification)

### 2. Extracts Sophisticated Logic
AI might discover patterns like:
```
- Chest 'good' zone: 38.0-44.0" (not 39.5-42.5")
- Brand prior weight: 0.3 (not 0.1)  
- Subcategory override: T-shirts prefer L, Polos prefer M
- Neck tolerance: Accept 15.5-16.5" for casual items
- Product fit intent: "Boxy" means intentionally roomy
```

### 3. Best of Both Worlds
- Fast, reliable traditional code
- Logic that actually matches user preferences
- No ongoing AI costs
- Works offline
- Privacy preserved

## Example Workflow

### Current System Issues:
```
User: "What size for BR Boxy Linen Shirt?"
System: "Size L (score: 0.72)" - but doesn't explain why
User: "But my Theory M fits great and has same measurements"
System: "Theory M classified as 'tight' - contradiction!"
```

### AI Training Period:
```
User: "What size for BR Boxy Linen Shirt?"
AI: "Size L recommended because you prefer L for T-shirts, and the 'boxy' fit means it's intentionally roomy. Your Theory M (38-40\" chest) was marked 'Good Fit' so M could work too, but L is safer for this style."
User: "Actually, M fit better"
AI: [Learns and adjusts understanding]
```

### Extracted Logic:
```
def recommend_size(product, user_profile):
    if product.subcategory == "t-shirt" and product.brand == "BR":
        if product.fit_intent == "boxy":
            return "L"  # Roomier fit
        else:
            return "M"  # Standard fit
    elif product.subcategory == "polo":
        return "M"  # User prefers M for polos
    # ... more learned patterns
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Start with Hybrid Approach
- Keep current system for 90% of cases
- Use AI for edge cases and explanations
- AI can override when it detects contradictions

### 2. Collect Training Data
- Track all AI recommendations
- Record user feedback (did they buy the recommended size?)
- Build dataset of successful vs failed recommendations

### 3. Extract and Validate
- After sufficient data, ask AI to generate code logic
- Implement extracted logic
- Compare results to AI recommendations
- Fine-tune until they match

## Key Advantages

1. **Avoids "GPT Wrapper" Problem** - AI is research tool, not the product
2. **Learns Real Preferences** - Not just hardcoded assumptions
3. **Extracts Sophisticated Patterns** - Brand quirks, subcategory preferences, fit intentions
4. **Maintains Performance** - Final system is fast traditional code
5. **Preserves Privacy** - No ongoing AI calls needed

## Next Steps

1. Prototype AI agent with current fit data
2. Test on a few products to see how AI reasoning differs from current system
3. Collect feedback on AI recommendations
4. Extract initial logic patterns
5. Implement extracted logic and validate

This approach uses AI as a sophisticated research tool to discover optimal recommendation logic, then extracts that logic into traditional code for performance and reliability.
