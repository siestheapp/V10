# Message to Send to Dilawer on Upwork

```
Hi Dilawer,

Great to have you on board! I've set up everything for you to properly troubleshoot the performance issues.

## Repository Access
GitHub: https://github.com/siestheapp/V10
Branch: contractor-performance-simple

Please fork the repository and work from your fork.

## Backend Access (IMPORTANT)
Since we need to identify if the lag is from iOS or the backend, I'm setting up a test server for you. The database only has fake test data anyway (user1 with random nonsensical feedback).

Option 1 - I'll deploy to Render (easiest):
- I'll send you the URL once deployed (takes 10 minutes)
- You won't need any database setup
- Real network latencies to debug

Option 2 - You run locally:
- The backend code is in src/ios_app/Backend/
- You'll need PostgreSQL
- I can provide a dump of the test data

Which do you prefer? I recommend Option 1 for simplicity.

## Performance Issues to Fix
Current measurements (iPhone 15 Pro simulator):
- Tab switching: ~450ms → Target: <200ms
- List scrolling: ~20 FPS → Target: 55+ FPS
- Button response: ~350ms → Target: <100ms
- Memory usage increases over time

## Key Areas to Investigate
1. SwiftUI view re-rendering (use Instruments)
2. API call patterns (might be too many requests)
3. Image loading/caching (no caching implemented)
4. List virtualization (not using LazyVStack properly?)
5. Tab view memory management

## Test Data Note
The user1 account has intentionally weird data (3XL marked "too small", S marked "too big") - this is just test data from random clicking. Don't worry about the data making sense, focus on performance.

Let me know:
1. Which backend option you prefer
2. When you'd like a quick call to review the issues
3. If you need any clarification

Looking forward to seeing those performance improvements!

Best,
Sean

## After He Responds:

### If he chooses Render (recommended):
1. Deploy using the render.yaml already in contractor branch
2. Give him the URL: https://v10-contractor-test.onrender.com
3. Backend will just work

### If he chooses local:
1. Export user1 data to SQL file
2. Share via secure link
3. Help with setup if needed

## Why This Approach is Perfect:

✅ **He can see the FULL picture** - iOS + Backend
✅ **Real performance testing** - Actual API latencies  
✅ **Can identify root cause** - Is it iOS, network, or database?
✅ **No security risk** - All fake data
✅ **Professional setup** - Shows you know what you're doing

## The Data is Fake Anyway!

Remember from your conversation:
- user1 clicked random buttons
- Data is intentionally nonsensical
- There's nothing confidential
- It's perfect test data for performance work
