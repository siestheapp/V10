# 🎯 TL;DR - Contractor Setup for iOS Performance Fix

Since your user1 data is all fake test data, here's the **simplest approach**:

## The 5-Minute Setup

```bash
# 1. Run this to prepare contractor branch
cd /Users/seandavey/projects/V10
chmod +x daily-notes/2025-09-17/simple_contractor_prep.sh
./daily-notes/2025-09-17/simple_contractor_prep.sh

# 2. This removes ONLY your scrapers (proprietary code)
# Everything else stays since the data is fake

# 3. Push to GitHub
git checkout contractor-performance-simple
git add -A
git commit -m "Contractor version - scrapers removed"
git push origin contractor-performance-simple
```

## What They Get
✅ Full iOS code  
✅ Backend API code  
✅ Database with fake user1 test data  
✅ Ability to run everything locally  

## What They DON'T Get
❌ Your web scrapers (the only real IP)  
❌ Production server credentials (if any)  

## Tell the Contractor This

```
The app has performance issues:
- Tab switching: 450ms → need <200ms
- Scrolling: 20 FPS → need 55+ FPS
- Button taps: 350ms → need <100ms

You have full access to iOS and backend code.
The database only has test data for user1@example.com.
This data is intentionally nonsensical (I clicked random buttons).

Focus on iOS UI performance. Run the backend locally to test.
```

## Daily Monitoring

```bash
# Check what they changed
cd /Users/seandavey/projects/V10
python daily-notes/2025-09-17/monitor_contractor_activity.py
```

## After Project Ends

```bash
# Merge good changes
git checkout revert-to-a42786
git merge contractor-performance-simple --squash

# Delete contractor branch  
git push origin --delete contractor-performance-simple
```

## Why This Works

1. **Your data is fake** - No confidentiality issues
2. **Scrapers are removed** - Your only real IP is protected
3. **Simple setup** - They can start immediately
4. **Real testing** - They test against actual backend, not mocks
5. **Better results** - They might find backend bottlenecks too

---

**Bottom line**: Since it's all test data, just remove the scrapers and share the rest. Much simpler than elaborate security theater!
