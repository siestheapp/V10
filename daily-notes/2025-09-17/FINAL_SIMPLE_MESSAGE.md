Hi Dilawer,

Great to have you on board! Everything is ready for you to start.

## Repository Access

GitHub: https://github.com/siestheapp/V10
Branch: contractor-performance-simple

Please fork the repository and work from your fork.

## Performance Issues to Fix

Current measurements (iPhone 15 Pro simulator):
- Tab switching: ~450ms → Target: <200ms
- List scrolling: ~20 FPS → Target: 55+ FPS
- Button response: ~350ms → Target: <100ms
- Memory usage increases over time

## Quick Start

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork  
3. Checkout `contractor-performance-simple` branch
4. Open `src/ios_app/V10.xcodeproj` in Xcode
5. Run on iPhone 15 Pro simulator
6. The app will auto-login with test data
7. Use Instruments (Cmd+I) to profile

The backend is already configured and the test data (user1) is intentionally nonsensical - focus on performance, not data accuracy.

Let's have a quick 15-minute call to review the issues. What time works for you today or tomorrow?

Best,
Sean
