# Testing From Contractor's Perspective

## Current Status
✅ You're on the contractor-performance-simple branch
✅ Backend is live at https://v10-2as4.onrender.com
✅ Config.swift is properly configured
✅ All iOS files are present

## Quick Tests to Run

### 1. Test Backend Directly (Terminal)
```bash
# Test brands endpoint
curl https://v10-2as4.onrender.com/brands | jq '.[0]'

# Test closet endpoint  
curl https://v10-2as4.onrender.com/user/1/closet | jq '.[0]'

# Check API docs
open https://v10-2as4.onrender.com/docs
```

### 2. Run iOS App (Xcode)
1. Xcode should be open now
2. Select iPhone 15 Pro simulator
3. Press Cmd+R
4. Watch for:
   - Auto-login (no sign-in needed)
   - Brands loading
   - Tab switching performance
   - Scrolling performance

### 3. Performance Issues to Look For
The contractor will be debugging these:
- Tab switching: Should feel laggy (~450ms)
- Scrolling: Should be choppy (~20 FPS)
- Button taps: Should have delay (~350ms)
- Memory: Check Debug Navigator → Memory

## Switch Back to Your Branch
When done testing:
```bash
git checkout revert-to-a42786
git stash pop
```
