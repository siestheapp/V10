# ClickUp Space Setup for iOS Performance Optimization

## üéØ Project Overview
**Project Name:** iOS App Performance Optimization  
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Contractor:** Dilawer Hussain (@dilawer-dev)  
**Goal:** Optimize UI responsiveness, memory usage, and network performance

## üìã Main Task Categories

### 1. üöÄ UI Performance & Responsiveness
- [ ] **Analyze UI lag in tab switching**
  - Priority: High
  - Description: App shows noticeable lag when switching between tabs (Scan, Finds, Closet, Fit, More)
  - Tools: Xcode Instruments (Time Profiler)
  - Expected outcome: Smooth 60fps transitions

- [ ] **Optimize ScrollView performance**
  - Priority: High  
  - Description: Lists in Closet and Finds tabs may have scroll lag with many items
  - Tools: Instruments (Core Animation)
  - Expected outcome: Smooth scrolling even with 100+ items

- [ ] **Fix SwiftUI view rendering issues**
  - Priority: Medium
  - Description: Identify and fix any unnecessary view redraws
  - Tools: SwiftUI View Inspector, Instruments
  - Expected outcome: Reduced CPU usage during UI updates

### 2. üß† Memory Optimization
- [ ] **Profile memory usage patterns**
  - Priority: High
  - Description: Use Instruments to identify memory leaks and high usage areas
  - Tools: Instruments (Allocations, Leaks)
  - Expected outcome: Memory usage report with recommendations

- [ ] **Optimize image loading and caching**
  - Priority: Medium
  - Description: Product images may be causing memory spikes
  - Focus areas: AsyncImage usage, cache management
  - Expected outcome: Reduced memory footprint for image handling

- [ ] **Fix potential retain cycles**
  - Priority: Medium
  - Description: Check for strong reference cycles in closures and delegates
  - Tools: Instruments (Leaks), Code review
  - Expected outcome: Zero memory leaks

### 3. üåê Network & Data Performance
- [ ] **Optimize API call patterns**
  - Priority: High
  - Description: Review and optimize network requests to backend
  - Focus areas: Unnecessary duplicate calls, request batching
  - Expected outcome: Reduced network overhead

- [ ] **Implement better loading states**
  - Priority: Medium
  - Description: Improve user experience during data loading
  - Focus areas: Skeleton screens, progress indicators
  - Expected outcome: Better perceived performance

- [ ] **Add offline data caching**
  - Priority: Low
  - Description: Cache frequently accessed data locally
  - Tools: Core Data or UserDefaults
  - Expected outcome: Faster app startup and reduced API calls

### 4. üîß Code Quality & Architecture
- [ ] **Review and refactor performance bottlenecks**
  - Priority: Medium
  - Description: Identify and fix inefficient code patterns
  - Tools: Static analysis, profiling
  - Expected outcome: Cleaner, more efficient codebase

- [ ] **Optimize build times**
  - Priority: Low
  - Description: Reduce Xcode build and compile times
  - Focus areas: Module organization, build settings
  - Expected outcome: Faster development iteration

## üìä Performance Metrics to Track

### Before/After Measurements
- [ ] **App launch time** (cold start)
- [ ] **Tab switching response time**
- [ ] **Memory usage** (peak and average)
- [ ] **Network request count** per user session
- [ ] **Battery usage** during typical usage
- [ ] **Frame rate** during animations and scrolling

### Tools for Measurement
- Xcode Instruments (Time Profiler, Allocations, Network)
- MetricKit for production metrics
- Manual timing with performance tests
