# Message to Send to Dilawer on Upwork

Hi Dilawer,

Quick update - I've moved the project to a dedicated repository for better organization:

**New Repository:** https://github.com/siestheapp/v10-dev

You should have received an invitation to this repository. Please:

1. Accept the GitHub invitation for `v10-dev` 
2. Remove your local copy of the old repository
3. Clone the new repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/siestheapp/v10-dev.git
cd v10-dev
```

4. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open src/ios_app/V10.xcodeproj
```

**Important changes:**
- The app now shows 5 tabs (Scan | Finds | Closet | Fit | More) - this is the correct view
- Backend is already deployed at: https://v10-2as4.onrender.com
- The app auto-logs in as user ID 1
- All test data is already in the database

**Your focus areas remain the same:**
1. UI lag and responsiveness issues
2. Memory and performance optimization  
3. Network and data handling improvements

The new repository has a cleaner structure and should be easier to work with. Let me know once you've cloned it and if you have any questions!

Thanks,
Sean
