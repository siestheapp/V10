## [2025-06-28 17:04] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- **NN07 Size Guide Ingestion:**
  - Added NN07 as new brand (ID: 17) to brands table
  - Ingested NN07 Clive 3323 Tee size guide data (S-XXL sizes)
  - Mapped "1/2 Chest Width" → "chest" in brand_automap table
  - Added center_back_length column to size_guides_v2 table
  - Inserted all size guide rows with chest, sleeve, and center_back_length measurements

- **Database Schema Evolution:**
  - Created size_guide_column_history table to track new columns, associated brands, reasons, and source URLs
  - Added trigger function set_measurements_available() to auto-populate measurements_available column
  - Created trigger on size_guides_v2 table for automatic measurements_available updates
  - Updated all existing rows to populate measurements_available via trigger

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Updated SCHEMA_EVOLUTION.md with center_back_length and size_guide_column_history additions
  - Updated DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md with new column and table documentation
  - Logged first entry in size_guide_column_history for center_back_length (added by SRD, source: NN07 Clive 3323 Tee)

- **Database Automation:**
  - Installed missing pytz dependency for snapshot scripts
  - Ran db_snapshot.py and schema_evolution.py to capture current state
  - Created comprehensive database change workflow documentation

- Added backend estimator (`body_measurement_estimator.py`) to calculate estimated chest measurement from user garment and fit feedback data.
- Updated FastAPI backend endpoint `/user/{user_id}/body-measurements` to use the estimator and return the estimated chest measurement.
- Created a SwiftUI `BodyScreen` with a ViewModel to fetch and display the estimated chest measurement in the iOS app.
- Verified end-to-end functionality: user can now see their estimated chest measurement on the Body screen in the app.

**Database Change Workflow Established:**
1. Make schema changes (SQL)
2. Update SCHEMA_EVOLUTION.md and DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md manually
3. Run python scripts/db_snapshot.py (creates JSON + Markdown snapshots)
4. Run python scripts/schema_evolution.py (updates evolution docs + SQL dumps)
5. Verify results and test functionality

**Notes:**
- Use piecemeal approach (run workflow after each change) for active development
- Trigger automatically populates measurements_available for all future size guide inserts
- size_guide_column_history tracks schema evolution rationale and sources
- Next time: Consider ingesting another brand with unique measurements to test the new workflow

## [2025-06-29] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- **Patagonia Measurement Instructions:**
  - Added Patagonia measurement instructions to `measurement_instructions` table (brand_id: 2) for chest, arm length, waist, and hips, including standardized terms and official instructions.
  - Used the correct admin and brand IDs, and verified the presence of timestamps in the schema.

- **Banana Republic Size Guide Ingestion:**
  - Confirmed correct table names in tailor3 (`size_guides`, `size_guide_entries`).
  - Inserted new size guide for Banana Republic Men's Shirts & Sweaters (brand_id: 5, category_id: 1, created_by: 1, source_url: https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=35404).
  - Parsed and inserted all size rows (XXS–XXL) with min/max/range columns for waist, chest, neck, sleeve, and belt, using the normalized schema.
  - Provided ready-to-paste SQL for each entry, clarified column mapping, and explained how to split ranges into min/max values.

- **Schema & Troubleshooting:**
  - Clarified the difference between tailor2 and tailor3 table names (e.g., `size_guides_v2` vs. `size_guides`).
  - Used `TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` as the source of truth for table/column names and constraints.
  - Helped debug SQL errors related to placeholder values and syntax, and provided corrected SQL for direct use in psql.

**Notes:**
- Always use actual numeric IDs in SQL, not placeholders like BRAND_ID or CATEGORY_ID.
- Use the normalized schema's min/max/range columns for all measurement fields.
- Reference official brand URLs for source attribution in size guides and instructions.
- If unsure about a table or column, check `TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` for the latest schema.
- Next time: Consider automating the range-to-min/max parsing for faster ingestion. 

## 2024-06-30 - NN.07 Clive 3323 Tee Size Guide Ingestion & Schema Update

## [2025-01-02] Session Summary - Web Interface Development & Progressive Feedback System

**What we did:**

- **Database Configuration & Change Logging:**
  - Created `DATABASE_CONFIG.md` documenting Supabase connection details and database state
  - Created `db_change_logger.py` - lightweight change logging system that tracks individual database changes with timestamps and user attribution
  - Updated `start_server.sh` to use correct "tailor3" database connection
  - Created `example_change_logging.py` demonstrating logger usage
  - Updated `garment_input_helper.py` to use change logger for all database operations

- **Web Interface Development:**
  - **User Interface (port 5001):** Created `web_garment_manager.py` with Flask routes for:
    - Dashboard with garment overview
    - Add garment form with dynamic dropdowns
    - View garment details with feedback options
    - Add feedback functionality
  - **Admin Interface (port 5002):** Created `admin_garment_manager.py` with:
    - Admin login system
    - Brand and category management
    - User activity viewing
    - Admin activity logging with `admin_activity_log` table
  - **Templates:** Created comprehensive Bootstrap templates:
    - `templates/base.html` - base template with navigation
    - `templates/index.html` - user dashboard
    - `templates/add_garment.html` - garment input form
    - `templates/view_garment.html` - garment details and feedback
    - `templates/progressive_feedback.html` - progressive feedback system
    - `templates/admin/` directory with admin interface templates

- **Database Enhancements:**
  - Fixed fit_type constraints (added "NA" option)
  - Made product_name nullable to accommodate closet items without exact product names
  - Added `admin_activity_log` table for tracking admin actions
  - Updated `feedback_codes` table with missing codes for progressive feedback system
  - Created `update_feedback_codes.py` to add "Perfect", "Slightly Tight", "Slightly Loose" codes

- **Progressive Feedback System Implementation:**
  - Implemented 5-point overall fit scale: "Too Tight" → "Slightly Tight" → "Perfect" → "Slightly Loose" → "Too Loose"
  - Created progressive disclosure UI: only ask dimension-specific questions if overall fit ≠ "Perfect"
  - Added JavaScript for dynamic form handling and progressive disclosure
  - Integrated with existing feedback database structure

- **Measurement Linking System:**
  - **Critical Discovery:** Found that garments were being added without linking to size guide measurements
  - **Solution:** Updated garment addition process to automatically:
    - Lookup size guides based on brand + category + gender + fit_type
    - Populate `size_guide_id` and `size_guide_entry_id` fields
    - Display measurement linking status to users
  - Enhanced garment display to show actual measurements (chest, waist, sleeve, etc.)
  - Created `test_measurement_linking.py` for testing the linking system
  - Fixed existing garments to link to proper measurements

- **Testing & Validation:**
  - Successfully tested feedback submission (user1 → Patagonia XL → "Slightly Loose")
  - Verified measurement data integration (Patagonia XL: Chest 47", Sleeve 36")
  - Confirmed change logging functionality across all operations
  - Tested both user and admin interfaces with real data

**New Files Created:**
- `DATABASE_CONFIG.md` - Database connection documentation
- `scripts/db_change_logger.py` - Change logging system
- `scripts/example_change_logging.py` - Logger usage examples
- `scripts/web_garment_manager.py` - User web interface
- `scripts/admin_garment_manager.py` - Admin web interface
- `scripts/update_feedback_codes.py` - Feedback code management
- `scripts/test_measurement_linking.py` - Measurement linking tests
- `scripts/templates/base.html` - Base template
- `scripts/templates/index.html` - User dashboard
- `scripts/templates/add_garment.html` - Garment input form
- `scripts/templates/view_garment.html` - Garment details
- `scripts/templates/progressive_feedback.html` - Progressive feedback UI
- `scripts/templates/admin/` - Complete admin interface templates

**Critical Insight - Feedback System Decision:**
After implementing the progressive feedback system, we discovered a fundamental issue with feedback interpretation. The progressive system asked "How does this fit?" but didn't capture whether the user LIKED that fit. For example, "Slightly Loose" could mean:
- User likes it slightly loose (positive feedback)
- User wants it tighter (negative feedback)

**Decision: Return to Original 7-Point System**
We're reverting to the original feedback codes that combine fit description + satisfaction:
- "Too Tight" / "Tight but I Like It" / "Good Fit" / "Loose but I Like It" / "Too Loose" etc.

This approach accommodates the reality that users have different fit preferences for different garments - some like their t-shirts loose, others like their dress shirts fitted. The 7-point system captures both the fit description AND the user's satisfaction with that fit, providing the detailed data needed for accurate recommendations.

**Database State:**
- Contains users, brands, size guides, garments, and feedback data
- Measurement linking system operational
- Change logging active for all database operations
- Both web interfaces functional and tested

**Next Steps:**
- Implement the original 7-point feedback system in the web interface
- Update progressive feedback UI to use satisfaction-based codes
- Continue testing with real user data to validate recommendation accuracy 

## [2025-07-03 02:00] Session Summary - Dimension Detection Bug Fix

**Issue Discovered:**
User reported that sleeve dimension was missing from progressive feedback form for Banana Republic shirt, even though we have sleeve data for that brand. This revealed a critical flaw in the dimension detection system where dimensions were "falling through the cracks."

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Original Flawed Logic:** System was checking measurements only for the **specific size** (e.g., "L") rather than checking what dimensions exist **across all sizes** for a brand
2. **Compounding Issue:** Garment 1 (Banana Republic shirt) had `size_guide_id = NULL`, so it was falling back to default dimensions `['chest', 'waist', 'length']` instead of using brand-specific dimensions
3. **Data Validation:** Confirmed Banana Republic has complete sleeve data (7/7 entries have sleeve measurements) but system wasn't detecting it

**Investigation Process:**
- Created `test_brand_dimensions.py` to analyze what dimensions exist for each brand
- Found Banana Republic has: Chest (7/7), Waist (7/7), Sleeve (7/7), Neck (7/7), Hip (0/7), Length (0/7)
- Created `test_garment_details.py` to debug specific garment linking issues
- Discovered garment 1 was added before measurement linking system was implemented
- Created `debug_size_guides.py` to test SQL queries and identify cursor/transaction issues

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Fixed Dimension Detection SQL:** Updated `web_garment_manager.py` to use brand-wide dimension registry:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       CASE WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN chest_min IS NOT NULL OR chest_max IS NOT NULL OR chest_range IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) > 0 THEN 'chest' END as chest,
       CASE WHEN COUNT(CASE WHEN sleeve_min IS NOT NULL OR sleeve_max IS NOT NULL OR sleeve_range IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) > 0 THEN 'sleeve' END as sleeve,
       ...
   FROM size_guide_entries 
   WHERE size_guide_id = [brand_size_guide_id]
   ```

2. **Fixed Data Iteration Logic:** Changed from iterating over RealDictRow object to iterating over `.values()` to properly extract non-None dimensions

3. **Fixed Missing Garment Links:** Created `manual_fix_garment.py` to link garment 1 to proper size guide:
   - Linked garment 1 to size guide 8 (Banana Republic Tops Male Regular)
   - Linked to size guide entry 25 (size L with measurements)

**Debugging Tools Created:**
- `scripts/test_brand_dimensions.py` - Analyzes dimensions available for each brand
- `scripts/test_garment_details.py` - Debug specific garment linking and dimension detection
- `scripts/debug_size_guides.py` - Test size guide queries and data integrity
- `scripts/fix_garment_links.py` - Automated tool to fix garments missing size guide links
- `scripts/test_parameterized_query.py` - Debug SQL parameterization issues
- `scripts/manual_fix_garment.py` - Manual fix for specific garment

**Result:**
✅ **Fixed!** Progressive feedback form now correctly shows **chest, waist, sleeve, neck** dimensions for Banana Republic shirt, eliminating the "falling through cracks" issue.

**Technical Insight:**
The solution creates an **automatic brand dimension registry** by querying across ALL size entries for a brand to determine which dimensions have data, ensuring comprehensive dimension detection regardless of specific size availability.

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/web_garment_manager.py` - Fixed dimension detection logic
- Database: Updated garment 1 with proper size guide links
