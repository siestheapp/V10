## [2024-06-28 01:51] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- Automated database snapshotting and schema evolution tracking (JSON, Markdown, and SQL snapshots)
- Created and updated constraints documentation (`DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md`) for all key tables
- Documented and standardized the size guide ingestion process (`SIZE_GUIDE_INGESTION.md`)
- Ingested Ted Baker menswear size guide:
  - Added Ted Baker to brands table
  - Inserted size guide rows into `size_guides_v2`
  - Mapped "collar" to "neck" and updated `brand_automap`
  - Updated existing rows with correct neck values
- Added sample valid inserts to constraints docs for future reference
- Discussed and documented future automation opportunities for ingestion (brand check, mapping, OCR, end-to-end tool)
- Set up a workflow for logging session summaries and context

**Notes:**
- Next time: Try ingesting another brand (e.g., Abercrombie) using the new workflow
- Consider prototyping a brand check/insert script or mapping engine
- Use this log to quickly get up to speed at the start of each session
