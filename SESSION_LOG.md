## [2025-06-28 17:04] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- **NN07 Size Guide Ingestion:**
  - Added NN07 as new brand (ID: 17) to brands table
  - Ingested NN07 Clive 3323 Tee size guide data (S-XXL sizes)
  - Mapped "1/2 Chest Width" → "chest" in brand_automap table
  - Added center_back_length column to size_guides_v2 table
  - Inserted all size guide rows with chest, sleeve, and center_back_length measurements

- **Database Schema Evolution:**
  - Created size_guide_column_history table to track new columns, associated brands, reasons, and source URLs
  - Added trigger function set_measurements_available() to auto-populate measurements_available column
  - Created trigger on size_guides_v2 table for automatic measurements_available updates
  - Updated all existing rows to populate measurements_available via trigger

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Updated SCHEMA_EVOLUTION.md with center_back_length and size_guide_column_history additions
  - Updated DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md with new column and table documentation
  - Logged first entry in size_guide_column_history for center_back_length (added by SRD, source: NN07 Clive 3323 Tee)

- **Database Automation:**
  - Installed missing pytz dependency for snapshot scripts
  - Ran db_snapshot.py and schema_evolution.py to capture current state
  - Created comprehensive database change workflow documentation

- Added backend estimator (`body_measurement_estimator.py`) to calculate estimated chest measurement from user garment and fit feedback data.
- Updated FastAPI backend endpoint `/user/{user_id}/body-measurements` to use the estimator and return the estimated chest measurement.
- Created a SwiftUI `BodyScreen` with a ViewModel to fetch and display the estimated chest measurement in the iOS app.
- Verified end-to-end functionality: user can now see their estimated chest measurement on the Body screen in the app.

**Database Change Workflow Established:**
1. Make schema changes (SQL)
2. Update SCHEMA_EVOLUTION.md and DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md manually
3. Run python scripts/db_snapshot.py (creates JSON + Markdown snapshots)
4. Run python scripts/schema_evolution.py (updates evolution docs + SQL dumps)
5. Verify results and test functionality

**Notes:**
- Use piecemeal approach (run workflow after each change) for active development
- Trigger automatically populates measurements_available for all future size guide inserts
- size_guide_column_history tracks schema evolution rationale and sources
- Next time: Consider ingesting another brand with unique measurements to test the new workflow

## [2024-06-28 01:51] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- Automated database snapshotting and schema evolution tracking (JSON, Markdown, and SQL snapshots)
- Created and updated constraints documentation (`DATABASE_CONSTRAINTS.md`) for all key tables
- Documented and standardized the size guide ingestion process (`SIZE_GUIDE_INGESTION.md`)
- Ingested Ted Baker menswear size guide:
  - Added Ted Baker to brands table
  - Inserted size guide rows into `size_guides_v2`
  - Mapped "collar" to "neck" and updated `brand_automap`
  - Updated existing rows with correct neck values
- Added sample valid inserts to constraints docs for future reference
- Discussed and documented future automation opportunities for ingestion (brand check, mapping, OCR, end-to-end tool)
- Set up a workflow for logging session summaries and context

**Notes:**
- Next time: Try ingesting another brand (e.g., Abercrombie) using the new workflow
- Consider prototyping a brand check/insert script or mapping engine
- Use this log to quickly get up to speed at the start of each session 

## [2025-06-29] Session Summary

**What we did:**
- **Patagonia Measurement Instructions:**
  - Added Patagonia measurement instructions to `measurement_instructions` table (brand_id: 2) for chest, arm length, waist, and hips, including standardized terms and official instructions.
  - Used the correct admin and brand IDs, and verified the presence of timestamps in the schema.

- **Banana Republic Size Guide Ingestion:**
  - Confirmed correct table names in tailor3 (`size_guides`, `size_guide_entries`).
  - Inserted new size guide for Banana Republic Men's Shirts & Sweaters (brand_id: 5, category_id: 1, created_by: 1, source_url: https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/info.do?cid=35404).
  - Parsed and inserted all size rows (XXS–XXL) with min/max/range columns for waist, chest, neck, sleeve, and belt, using the normalized schema.
  - Provided ready-to-paste SQL for each entry, clarified column mapping, and explained how to split ranges into min/max values.

- **Schema & Troubleshooting:**
  - Clarified the difference between tailor2 and tailor3 table names (e.g., `size_guides_v2` vs. `size_guides`).
  - Used `TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` as the source of truth for table/column names and constraints.
  - Helped debug SQL errors related to placeholder values and syntax, and provided corrected SQL for direct use in psql.

**Notes:**
- Always use actual numeric IDs in SQL, not placeholders like BRAND_ID or CATEGORY_ID.
- Use the normalized schema's min/max/range columns for all measurement fields.
- Reference official brand URLs for source attribution in size guides and instructions.
- If unsure about a table or column, check `TAILOR3_SCHEMA.md` for the latest schema.
- Next time: Consider automating the range-to-min/max parsing for faster ingestion. 

## 2024-06-30 - NN.07 Clive 3323 Tee Size Guide Ingestion & Schema Update

- Ingested NN.07 Clive 3323 Tee size guide (brand_id: 6, size_guide_id: 9) as product-level guide.
- Created subcategory "Long Sleeve Tees" (subcategory_id: 1) under "Tops".
- Inserted size guide entries with full chest (doubled from 1/2 chest) and sleeve (CBL to cuff, +9").
- Added measurement instructions for 1/2 Chest Width, Center Back Length, and Sleeve Length.
- Added standardization_log entries for chest and sleeve transformations.
- Inserted raw size guide with fit_type = 'Unspecified' after updating schema constraint.
- Updated schema: allowed 'Unspecified' as a fit_type in both raw_size_guides and size_guides.
- Updated fit_type in both tables to 'Unspecified' for this guide for consistency.
